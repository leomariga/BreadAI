Garth's Good Breads

breads

1 teaspoon sugar, granulated
2 tablespoon dry yeast
1/2 cup sugar, granulated salt; heaping
1/2 cup vegetable oil
9 cup flour, all purpose

Garth Turner is a 'dark horse' candidate for the leadership of
Canada's Conservative party and it is unlikely he will be our next
prime minister.

In a large warm pottery bowl, place water and sugar; sprinkle in
yeast. When yeast has risen to the surface blend and add water,
sugar, salt and oil. Beat in 1 cup of flour at a time. mix till your
biceps feel it and keep mixing til dough hangs together but is floppy
and moist.

Turn dough out onto a well-floured surface, sprinkle on a bit of
flour and knead with the heels of your palms until dough is smooth
and elastic. Return dough to bowl and cover with your best tea towel.
Let dough rise away from drafts til double in size.

Divide dough into 3 sections and fashion loaves into 3 well greased
tins - black ones are best. Bake in preheated 400F 20 minutes til
brown on top and bottom. remove from loaf pans and cool.

MAKES: 3 LOAVES

VARIATIONS: When mixing in flour, turner suggests adding 1/2 lb
raisins, 1 cup shredded cheese or 2 pks onion soup mix.

Gf Starter For Sourdough

breads, sourdough

1  pinch sugar
1 cup lukewarm water
1 tablespoon yeast granules
1 1/2 cup white rice flour

This recipe is intended for people who are allergic to gluten and
cannot make starter with wheat flour.

In a quart glass container or crock, add the sugar to the warm water.
Dissolve the yeast in the mixture. Add the flour, stirring well. Let
sit in a warm place until fermented and bubbly, 2 to 3 hours. When
bubbly and risen a little, cover and refrigerate. Starter is ready to
be used.

At each using, the cookbook author finds it works best if taken from
the fridge and allowed to warm about 1 hour before putting into the
dough mixture.

After each use, replenish the started by mixing in 1/2 cup lukewarm
water and 3/4 cup rice flour. Adapted from More from the Gluten-Free

Giant Oven Pancake

breads

1/4 cup butter
2  egg
1/2 cup flour
1/2 cup milk
1 dash nutmeg
1  lemon juice
1  sugar, confectioners

Melt butter in 10 inch pie pan or cast iron skillet. In bowl, mix all
flour, milk and eggs.  Don't over beat, leave lumpy. Pour mixture on
top of melted butter, sprinkle with nutmeg. Bake at 425 F. for 15 to
20 minutes. Sprinkle with lemon juice and dust with powdered sugar.
Serve with preserves or marmalade. I find that splitting the batter
in two halves, and baking it in metal pie plates works well, that way
you don't have to cut it in half. A squirt of fresh lemon juice, a
dusting of powdered sugar, and FAR too much apricot preserves on top
makes it a fantastic breakfast...

to 2 months.

PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Dissolve yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in warm
water. Beat 1/2 cup butter in food processor until light. Gradually
add remainder of sugar as you beat butter. Add lemon and orange
peels, mace, coriander and salt. Add yeast mixture. Add eggs, 1 at a
time, beating well after each addition, and then milk. Add enough
flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to make soft dough. Knead dough until

1/4 cup butter and use to lightly brush tops of loaves.

TO PRESENT AS A GIFT: Make paper ribbon strips the width of your gift
ribbons and tie the bread loosely with the paper strips; secure with
paper clips, leaving enough room for the breads to rise. The paper
will leave marks for the position of the gift ribbons. Cover the
loaves with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled,
30-to-40 minutes. Bake loaves about 30-to-45 minutes. Remove and
place on a rack to cool. Remove the paper strips. Replace strips with

Girdle Scones

breads, canadian, scottish

3 1/2 cup flour; all purpose*
6 tablespoon baking powder salt
1 tablespoon sugar; granulated
1/4 cup shortening or lard
1  egg
1 1/2 cup milk

*Canadian all purpose flour is very hard; the American equilvant is
bread flour This recipes comes from the town of Fergus, Ontario,
founded by two Scots in the 1880s. A girdle is a large cast iron pan.

Heat flat cast iron pan on low heat for 10 to 15 minutes or until
hot. (To test, sprinkle with a little flour; if it browns in 10 to 15
seconds, the pan is hot enough.) Meanwhile in a large mixing bowl,
stir flour, baking powder, salt and sugar; with fingertips, rub in
shortening or lard till crumbly. Whisk egg with 1 cup of the milk.
Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients; pour in the liquid.
With wooden spoon, stir to make soft, but not sticky dough, adding
more milk as needed. Turn out onto floured board, knead 3 or 4 times.
Pat or roll to no more than 1/4 - 1/2 inch. With sharp knife, cut
into small triangles. Place a few at a time on pan; cook, rotating
scones occasionally for 5 to 6 minutes or until bottoms are browned.
Serve hot. MAKES: approx 2 DOZEN

Gobhi Paratha

breads, indian

      ----DOUGH----
4 cup whole-wheat flour
1  to 3 cups cold water
3/4 cup ghee
      ----CAULIFLOWER FILLING----
2 tablespoon ghee
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic
1/2 cup finely chopped onions
1 teaspoon turmeric
1/8 teaspoon ground hot red pepper
1 medium cauliflower, trimmed, and coarsely; chopped
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh hot green chil; i (caution)
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon salt
6  to 8 tablespoons ghee

Indian Flat bread with spiced cauliflower filling

DOUGH:

Prepare the whole-wheat dough in the following fashion: In a small
bowl, combine the whole-wheat flour and 1/4 cup of the ghee. With
your fingertips rub the flour and fat together until they look like
flakes of coarse meal. Pour 1 cup of water over the mixture all at
once, knead together vigorously, and gather the dough into a compact
ball. If the dough crumbles, add up to 2 cups more water, 1/4 cup at
a time, until the particles adhere.

On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough by folding it end to
end, then pressing it down and pushing it forward several times with
the heel of your hand. Repeat for 7 or 8 minutes, until the dough is
smooth and elastic.  Again gather it into a ball. Place the dough in
a bowl, drape a kitchen towel over the top, and let it rest at room
temperature for at least 30 minutes before rolling it.

CAULIFLOWER FILLING:

Meanwhile, in a heavy 10 to 12-inch skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of
ghee over high heat until a drop of water flicked into it splutters
instantly. Stir in the ginger and garlic, then the onions. Lower the
heat to moderate and, stirring constantly, fry the mixture for 7 or 8
minutes, until the onions are soft and golden brown. Watch carefully
for any sign of burning and regulate the heat accordingly.

Stir in the turmeric, red pepper, cauliflower, chili, cumin and salt.
Reduce the heat to low, cover tightly and cook for 10 minutes, or
until the cauliflower is tender but still slightly resistant to the
bite. To make the parathas, divide the cauliflower mixture into 9
equal portions. Divide the dough also into 9 portions and drape a
dampened kitchen towel over them to keep the dough moist.

One at a time, on a lightly floured surface, roll a ball of dough
into a round about 5 inches in diameter. Place a portion of the
filling mixture in the center of the round and fold the edges over
it, pressing them together to enclose the filling securely.  Pat the
filled paratha flat with your hands, then gently roll it again to
make a round about 5 inches in diameter. As you shape and fill the
parathas, set them aside, covered with a dampened kitchen towel to
keep them from drying out.

Heat an ungreased 10 to 12-inch skillet with a non stick finish or a
well-seasoned cast-iron skillet or griddle until it is hot enough for
a drop of water flicked into it to splutter instantly. Place one of
the parathas in the pan and, moving it about constantly with your
fingers or the edge of a metal spatula, cook for a minute or so. With
a wide spatula, turn the paratha over and brush about a teaspoon of
the ghee on the top. Cook for 2 minutes, then turn it over, spread
with another teaspoon of ghee and cook for I minute. Turning
frequently, continue to cook until the paratha is brown on both
sides.  (When you have mastered the technique, you will find you can
fry 2 or 3 parathas at a time, depending on the size of your skillet
or griddle.)

Serve the parathas warm, as a mealtime bread.  They are traditionally
accompanied by plain yoghurt or any rayta. Parathas may be cooked
ahead and reheated in a hot ungreased skillet for a minute or so on
each side.

Makes nine 5-inch breads.

Gobi Paratha

breads, indian, vegetarian

3 cup flour
1 1/2 cup finely grated cauliflower or- steam; ed cabbage
2 tablespoon ghee
1 bunch sliced coriander leaves  (1 handful; )
3  green chilies; minced
1 each 1/2 piece ginger; minced
1 tablespoon mango powder
1  a few sliced mint leaves
1  salt
1  chili powder

Mix together salt and flour.  Rub in ghee, then add enough water to
make a stiff dough.  Mix together the rest of the ingredients. Divide
the dough in lemon-sized balls.  Then roll out each ball into a not
too thin disc or a chapati on a floured board.  Spread the
cauliflower mixture on one round chapati and cover with another round
chapati. Seal the edges nicely, sprinkle a little dry flour on top,
then roll out the paratha as thinly and as roundly as you can, being
careful not to break it. Grease a smoking tava or a girdle [Uhhh...I
think they mean a "griddle" -KM] with ghee and place the paratha over
it.  When the undersize [sic] turns a little golden coloured, apply
ghee on the top and turn over. Press gently and cover this side also
with some ghee.  Keep turning and applying a little ghee until the
paratha turns golden coloured. Serve it piping hot with a tablespoon
of butter and a bowl of seasoned curds.

1 tablespoon sugar
1 each eggwash
1 1/2 cup water, 110 deg f.
5 cup whole wheat flour

1/2  to 3/4 cup warm water
4 tablespoon honey
1 pkg active dry yeast
1/8 teaspoon ground saffron, optional
2 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup golden raisins, optional
1  honey

cleans the sides of the bowl. Process until ball turns around bowl
about 25 times. Turn off processor and let dough stand 1 to 2 minutes.

Turn on processor and gradually drizzle in enough remaining water to
make dough soft, smooth and satiny but not sticky. Process until

Turn dough onto lightly floured surface.  Knead raisins into dough, if
desired.  Shape into ball and place in lightly greased bowl, turning
to grease all sides. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let stand in
warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.

Punch down dough.  Divide dough into 3 equal parts. Shape each part
into strand 20 inches long.  Braid strands loosely together and place
on greased cookie sheet or in greased 2 quart ring mold or tube pan.
Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let stand in warm place until
almost doubled, about 45 minutes.

Golden Raisin Loaves

breads, fruits

2 cup whole wheat flour; stirred
2 pkg active dry yeast; or
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup water
1/2 cup buttermilk
1 1/2 cup raisins; golden
1 single vegetable oil
2 cup confectioners' sugar
2 1/2 teaspoon milk
1/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoon active dry yeast; bulk
2 teaspoon cinnamon; ground
1/3 cup butter or regular margarine
2 each eggs; lg
2 1/2 cup unbleached flour; sifted -----vanilla frost
1/4 teaspoon vanilla

NOTE:  The amount of flour can vary from 2 1/4 to 2 3/4 cups
depending on Stir 1 3/4 cups of the whole wheat flour, sugar,
undissolved yeast, salt and cinnamon together in a large mixing bowl.
Heat the water and butter in a saucepan over low heat to very warm
(120-130 degrees F.). Remove from the heat and stir in the
buttermilk. Add to the flour-yeast mixture and beat, with an electric
mixer on medium speed, until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs
and beat an additional 2 minutes, then stir in the raisins. Gradually
add the remaining 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour and enough white flour
to make a stiff but light dough. (Heaviness indicates too much flour
and the bread will not rise correctly.) Let rest for 5 minutes. Turn
the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth,
about 5 to 8 minutes. Cover with the mixing bowl and let rest for 30
minutes. Punch the dough down and divide in half.  Let rest 10
minutes, then roll each half to a 12 X 7-inch rectangle. Beginning at
the 7-inch side, roll up tightly like a jelly roll and seal the
edges. Tuck the ends under to form rounded edges, (the loaf should be
about 7 X 3-inches in size). Place on a greased baking sheet. Brush
with oil and repeat for the second batch of dough.  Cover and let
rise in a warm place until almost doubled, about 30 minutes.  Bake in
a preheated 375 degree F. oven for 25 minutes or until the loaves
sound hollow when tapped. Remove from the baking sheet and cool on
wire racks for 20 minutes. Frost with the vanilla icing if desired.

Gougeres (Cheese Puffs)

appetizers, breads, cheese/eggs, misc

1 cup water
1/2 cup butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 cup sifted flour
4  eggs
4 oz grated gruyere cheese
2 tablespoon dijon mustard

The easiest and most consistent way to form the gougeres is to pipe
out small rounds using a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip.
Lacking this, you could also use 2 teaspoons.

PREHEAT OVEN TO 425F. Place the water, butter, salt and pepper in a
small saucepan and bring to a boil. Immediately remove from the heat
(do not allow it to boil for any length of time) and add the flour
all at once. Stir with a wooden spoon until a ball forms. Return to
medium heat to dry the paste. Flatten the paste on the bottom of the
pan, bring it up to the side of the pan nearest you, then flop it
over to the opposite side of the pan. Continue until butter starts
oozing out in bubbles, about 5 minutes. When pinched, the paste
should not stick to your fingers. Remove from the heat and wait 5
minutes until slightly cooled, then beat in the eggs one at a time,
waiting until each is incorporated before adding the next. Add the
cheese and mustard. Butter a baking sheet, then rinse under cold
water, or place parchment paper on the baking sheet. Pipe out small
dots, about 1/2-inch in diameter, leaving enough room for them to
triple in size. Brush with beaten egg or milk, sprinkle with more
cheese, and bake for 15 minutes. Lower the heat to 400F, open the
oven door briefly to let the steam escape and then bake for an
additional 10 minutes. Cool on a rack. Gougeres freeze well.

Graham Crackers Or Digestive Biscuits

breads

1 kg (4 cups) whole wheat flour
250 gm (1 cup) butter
250 gm (1 cup) dark brown sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
1  lightly beaten egg
125 ml (1/2 cup) hot water

Cut butter into flour until mixture is like coarse meal. Add all other
ingredients, but only enough water to make dough into pastry
consistency. Roll out on a floured surface till very thin (about 3 mm
[1/8"] to 6 mm [1/4"] thick). Cut into small squares, depending on
what size you prefer. Bake on *unoiled* baking sheets until golden
brown, about 15 minutes. Cool on rack.

Yield: 2 dozen. These crackers are very popular in the US for babies,
but I have never seen them in the UK. They are delicious spread with
cream cheese and apricot preserves--or strawberry, or red currant
jelly, etc.

Graham Granola Bread

breads

1 1/2  envelopes dry yeast or 1 1/2 cakes; fresh yeast
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 cup warm water
1 cup water
1 cup buttermilk
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
1/4 cup honey or firmly packed brown sugar
1 1/4 cup graham or whole wheat flour
1 cup granola, finely ground in processor; or blender
1/2 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1  egg, room temperature
3 1/2  to 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour or; bread flour

Makes 2 loaves

Sprinkle dry yeast and sugar over 1/2 cup warm water (105 - 115 F) in
small bowl and stir to dissolve.  If using cake yeast, crumble into
small bowl. Stir in sugar and 1/2 cup lukewarm water (95 F). Let
mixture stand until foamy, about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat 1 cup water, buttermilk, butter and honey in heavy
small saucepan to lukewarm (95 F), stirring until butter melts.
Combine graham flour, granola, oats, walnuts and salt in large bowl.
Add yeast and lukewarm liquid mixture, then egg, whisking until
thick, about 5 minutes. Using wooden spoon, mix in enough all-purpose
flour 1/2 cup at a time to form soft dough. Knead on floured surface
until smooth and elastic, kneading in more all-purpose flour if dough
is sticky.

Grease large bowl and add dough, turning to coat entire surface.
Cover bowl with plastic.  Let rise in warm draft-free area until
dough is doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

Grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans (preferably black steel). Gently knead
dough on lightly floured surface until deflated. Cut dough in half.
Pat each piece out into rectangle. Roll up jelly roll fashion,
pinching seams to seal.  Place seam side down in prepared pans. Cover
with towel. Let rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume,
about 45 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375 F.  Bake until loaves sound hollow when tapped on
bottom, about 40 minutes.  Immediately remove from pans. Cool
completely on wire racks.

Grandma Mackay's Cranberry Bread

breads, quick bread

2 cup flour, all-purpose
1 cup sugar, granulated
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup orange juice (juice of one large or; ange)
2 tablespoon shortening
1 tablespoon orange peel, grated (one large oran; ge)
1  egg, beaten
1 cup cranberries, halved or chopped
1 cup walnuts or pecans, chopped

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease the bottom, but not the sides, of
two small loaf pans.

In a large bowl, sift together all the dry ingredients (flour, sugar,
baking powder, baking soda and salt). Blend very well.

Mix together the orange juice, orange peel, melted shortening and beaten
egg. Mix only enough to blend uniformly. Mix in the cranberries and the
nuts; stir gently. Pour the mixture into the loaf pans. Push it to the
corners, leaving the center slightly hollow.

Bake about an hour at 350 degrees F.  The loaves are done when a toothpick
inserted in the middle comes out clean.  Cool completely before cutting. Do
not try to serve warm.

NOTES:

*  A festive cranberry-orange nut-bread -- My grandmother MacKay clipped
this recipe from the 1951 edition of the Pillsbury Bake-Off competition
recipes, and we've made it a family tradition ever since. From time to time
my mother and I have both tried to improve on the recipe, but it appears
that the recipe is already perfect; every variation we have ever tried has
been disappointing by comparison.

When I was a boy, before the invention of the food processor, making this
bread required cutting the cranberries in half by hand, with a knife, and
the person who brought 4 loaves of cranberry bread to the family
Thanksgiving meal was more welcome than the person who brought the turkey.
Now, between Baker's Secret loaf pans and Cuisinart slicer blades, you can
knock out 8 perfect loaves of the stuff while watching one episode of
Sesame Street.  My grandmother still cuts each cranberry in half with a
paring knife, and hers still tastes better than mine. Yield: 2 small
loaves.

*  It takes practice to know when to stop mixing the dough.  If you mix too
much, the bread gets a chewy texture to it, whereas it should have a very
crumbly consistency, like a muffin or cornbread.

*  It really makes a difference in the texture of this bread to use a
shortening that is solid at room temperature, like Crisco.  It really makes
a difference in the flavor to use fresh orange-peel and not powdered. I
prefer walnuts to pecans.

*  It might seem sensible to try to use the same orange for the peel and
the juice, but it is really more trouble than it is worth to try to peel a
juiced orange or juice a peeled orange. I usually use two oranges and eat
the one that I took the peel from.

*  This bread keeps well in the freezer.  Specifically, it keeps from
Thanksgiving to Christmas.  It also survives quite well being mailed by
parcel post from Indiana to Maryland.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation if you have a food processor, 2 hours
baking and cooling.
: Precision:  Measure carefully.

Grandma Skinner's Griddle Scones

breads

3 cup flour
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 teaspoon sugar
1 tablespoon butter
1 1/2 cup buttermilk

Sift all of the dry ingredients together into a bowl. By hand, rub the
butter into the flour, making small cornmeal-like granules. Add
buttermilk all at once. Working quickly but gently, mix with a dinner
knife (spoons overwork the dough, making a tough scone) until the
dough is just barely mixed. Add a little more buttermilk if
necessary, but don't make the dough sticky.

Divide the dough into quarters. On a floured board, roll out each
quarter into a circle 1/4" thick. Cut each circle into quarters. Bake
the scones in batches on a medium-hot (350øF) lightly greased griddle
for a few minutes, until lightly golden. Turn and cook the other
side. Now brown all the edges in turn by standing the triangles up
and leaning them against each other for about 30 seconds. As the
scones come off the griddle, cool in a tea towel until ready to use.

Grandma Vanicek's Czechoslovakian Potato Dump

breads, ethnic

6 medium potatoes
1  egg yolk
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2  all-purpose flour

These are *not* fluffy dumplings as in chicken and dumplings. They
are a "sturdy" potato dumpling served as a side dish to meat, and
usually with a sweet sauerkraut/carraway/honey dish as the vegetable.

*                       *
*

Boil peeled potatoes in small quantity of water. Drain potatoes
thoroughly. Rice potatoes through hand held masher/ricer. Let
potatoes cool. On floured board, gradually add flour working mixture
into dough with hands. Shape potato mixture into a long roll and cut
into 10 slices. Drop dumplings into boiling water and boil gently
about 5 minutes.

Drain dumplings on paper towel.  The dumplings are fully cooked after
the boiling process, but traditionally, Czechoslovakians then melt
butter in a heavy frying pan, and fry the dumplings until they are
lightly browned on all sides.

Grape Bread (Mustaceus)

breads

4 cup unbleached, all-purpose
1  flour
1/2 cup lard, shortening, or butter
1  melted and cooled
1/4 cup feta cheese, crumbled and
1  mashed into a paste
1 teaspoon cumin seed, ground
1 teaspoon anise, ground
1 1/2 cup grape juice, purple or white
1 pkg dry yeast
8  bay leaves

1) Place the flour, lard, mashed cheese, ground cumin and anise,
and yeast in a large mixing bowl. Blend well. Add the grape juice and
mix the dough well for 2-3 minutes until all the grape juice is
absorbed and evenly distributed.  The dough will be damp and sticky,
but no internal dry areas should appear by the end of the mixing. If
they do, mix a few minutes more or add a little more grape juice and
mix again.

2) Let the dough rest 5 minutes.  Now sprinkle 1 or 2 tbsp. flour
over the dough and knead, either in the bowl or on a lightly floured
surface for 5-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic and
only slightly sticky.  Add more flour if needed.  Let the dough rest
2 minutes.

3) The dough should now be very smooth and easy to handle. Knead 30
seconds more, return the dough to the bowl, cover the bowl with a dish
towel or large plate, and let rise at room temperature for at least 3
hours.

4) Sprinkle top with flour, punch down, and form the dough into 4
rectangular loaves (4 in. by 2 in. by 2-1/2 in.). Place two bay
leaves on the bottom of each loaf, and lay them, leaf side down, on a
greased cookie sheet.  Cover with a towel and let rise for 1 hour,
until well risen.

5) Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 35 minutes, until the
loaves are brown on top and make a hollow sound when tapped on the
bottom. Serve when cool. NOTE: To make these breads without
leavening, omit the yeast, knead the dough thoroughly, then bake at
350 degrees for about 2 hours. They will be chewy and moist, and very
foreign to our taste. The Romans thought unleaven bread was manlier
and much better for the digestion.

Grape Starter

breads

      ----COOKING WITH MASTER CHEFS----
      ----FIRST DAY----
1/2 lb stemmed red grapes
2 cup bread flour
2 1/2 cup water
      ----THREE DAYS BEFORE USING----
1 cup flour
1 cup water
      ----TWO DAYS BEFORE USING----
1 cup flour
1 cup water
      ----ONE DAY BEFORE USING----
1 cup flour
1 cup water

It takes 10 days to complete but is then yours for life. Wrap the
grapes in well washed cheesecloth, tieing the corners to form a bag;
lightly crush them with a rolling pin (to release the sugar to mix
with the natural yeast on the skins; just like making wine!) and
immerse them in the flour water mix.  Cover tightly with a lid or
plastic wrap secured with a rubber band. Leave at room temperature
for 6 days, stirring once or twice a day for the six days.

The bag of grapes will eventually appear inflated, and liquid will
begin to separate from the flour base. The mixture will begin to
taste and smell slightly fruity, and the color will be strange. That
is as it should be. By the sixth day the bag of grapes will have
deflated, the color will be yellow, and the taste pleasantly sour;
the fermentation is complete. The starter is living but weak, and it
needs to be fed.

Remove the grapes and squeeze their juices back into the starter.
Stir it up thouroughly and transfer it to a clean container.
(Although you can use it after just one feeding, the starter will be
stronger and healthier with the full treatment)  You can refrigerate
it until you're ready to proceed.

Three days before you plan to use it, stir 1 cup flour and 1 cup
water into the container, blending well. Let stand uncovered at room
temperature until it bubbles up - 3 to 4 hours - then cover and
refrigerate. Repeat this for the second and third day.

Store the starter tightly covered in the refrigerator where it will
keep perfectly for 4 to 6 months.- after which it's a good idea to
pour off all but 2 cups and give it another feeding. Before using the
stored starter for bread, however, give it the full 3-day feeding
schedule once again to restore it and to tone down excess sourness.

Sylvia's comments: I bought a big bunch of black grapes for this
(didn't remember that the recipe called for red grapes) and put them
into 2 cheesecloth packages, which made cramming them into the
container a bit difficult.  I wasn't sure how much to crush the
grapes, so only used a little pressure with my hands, just enough to
dampen the cheesecloth with grape juice. Later note: I should have
crushed more, after 6 days the grapes were still pretty intact.  I
squeezed everything I could out of one of my packets and threw it
away, crushed the other more thoroughly and stuck in back in the
starter.

Grasmere Gingerbread

breads, ethnic

1 lb fine oatmeal
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
4 teaspoon ground ginger
1 pinch allspice
1/2 lb pale muscovado sugar
1/2 lb butter
2 tablespoon golden syrup

Line a swiss roll or baking tin measuring about 9 x 13 inches with
bakewell or greaseproof paper and grease it well. Stir the dry
ingredients together. Melt the butter and syrup over low heat, pour
on to the dry ingredients and stir well to make a fairly stiff
mixture. Spread the mixture evenly over the base of the prepared tin
and bake at 350 F (180 C) gas mark 4 for 25-30 minutes.  Do not be
alarmed by the fact that the mixture will look a little runny when it
emerges from the oven; this is normal. Mark the biscuits into fingers
or squares while still warm but leave in the tin until completely
cold.  Don't make the biscuits very big ~ they are chewy and very
filling. Good exercise for the jaws and high in calories. Source:

Grated Raw Potato Starter

breads, potatoes

1 cup warm water
1 teaspoon sugar
1 1/2 cup white flour
1 medium grated potato
1 teaspoon salt

Mix the 1 cup warm water, 1-1/2 cups white flour and 1 tsp. each salt
and sugar in a 2-cup measure.  Add enough grated potato to make 2
cups. Place in a wide mouth glass jar or small mixing bowl (do not
use metal or plastic) which will hold about 1 quart. Cover with a
single thickness of cheesecloth to allow wild yeast from the air to
settle into it for 24 hours.  Stir well, cover tightly with a
clinging transparent wrap which will cause the moisture to drip back
and keep top of mixture from drying. Stir several times a day. In two
or three days it will become foamy and very light. (The length of
time depends on temperature. 80 ~85 is ideal. It can go a little
below 80 without harm, only slowing the procedure a little, but if it
goes much higher than 85 it will be spoiled.) Then stir well, pour
into glass jar with screw-top lid and store in refrigerator at about
38 degrees.  As soon as 1/2 inch of clear liquid has risen to the top
it has ripened enough to start using. Do not be concerened if the
mixture turns dark because of the raw potato during the fermentation
period. It does not affect the bread made from it in any way and as
soon as the starter is mature, it will become a snowy white. To renew
starter: Add 1-1/2 cups white flour and 1-1/2 cups water each time it
is used so that there are always 2 cups to bake with and 2 full cups
to return to refrigerator.  If for some reason it cannot be used
regularly about twice a week, add 1 tsp. sugar and stirr well every
three or four days.

Greek Tsoureki ( Easter Bread)

breads, holiday, greek

1 cup milk
1/2 cup sweet butter
1 pkg active dry yeast
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2  eggs; beaten
5 tablespoon orange juice
1 tablespoon grated orange rind
5 1/2 cup sifted flour
1  butter; melted
1  red-dyed, hard-boiled eggs
1/4 cup slivered almonds
2 tablespoon granulated sugar

In a small saucepan, combine the milk and butter over medium heat and
scald.  Stir until the butter melts, then pour into a mixing bowl.
When lukewarm, sprinkle in the yeast, and with fingers or a heavy
spoon gradually stir in the 1/2 cup sugar until it dissolves.  Then
add the salt, eggs 3 tablespoons of the orange juice, and the orange
rind, stirring continuously, and gradually add half the flour until
the mixture begins to bubble.  Continue adding flour gradually by
hand; the dough will be sticky, but should not be stiff.  Flour your
fingers lightly and knead for 15 minutes.  Place the dough in a large
buttered bowl, brush the dough with melted butter, cover, and place
in a warm area to rise until doubled in bulk (approximately 2 to 3
hours).
Punch the dough down and divide into 2 parts.  Divide each half
into 3 parts and roll each into a long rope about 10" x 2".  Braid
the three ropes together; pinch to seal the ends if leaving long, or
join together to form a long round loaf (see note below).  Repeat
with the other half of the dough to make a second tsoureki.  Place in
large baking pans or on a cookie sheet, cover, and let rise until
doubled in bulk (approx. 1 1/2 hours).
Meanwhile, prepare the glaze by mixing the remaining orange juice,
remaining sugar, and the almonds in a small bowl.  Bake the tsourekia
in a 375 degree oven for 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and with a
pastry brush glaze the tops and sides of loaves.  Return to the oven
and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes until the color is a rich and
shiny chestnut.
Note:  If using the Easter eggs, tuck them into the center when you
shape the loaves, leave until loaves have doubled and bake them with
the loaf.  After baking, though lovely, the eggs will be inedible.
Also in some provinces, the tsoureki is formed with a large braid and
a smaller one over it, making a much larger loaf requiring a longer
baking time.

Grenadine Slices

breads

1  portion four-way sweet 1/2 cup gren; adine syrup

*Use Grated Raw Potato Starter

Bread Dough                     1 cup Grape-Nuts Cereal

As soon as the bread dough has started to rise mix the syrup and
grape-nuts together so that the cereal will have time to soak up all
the syrup. Roll the dough out quite thin to about 20 x 10 inches. Cut
in two crosswise. Spread filling thinly over the surface leaving a
2-inch strip along one side of each square. Fold over this bare strip
onto filling and continue folding until a flat roll is formed. Lay
both rolls lengthwise on 10 x 15 inch cookie sheet with seam on
underside. Flatten them by rolling with the pin until they are about
3-1/2 inches wide and as long as the pan. Do this gently so that the
filling does not break through. Brush tops with soft butter.  Let
stand in warm place until light. Bake in oven preheated to 325 about
45 minutes until the crust has a beautiful bisque tint. Glaze while
still warm with a powdered sugar and White Wine frosting. If
available, decorate with a row of candy raspberries down the center
of each roll so that there will be one on each 1- 1/2 inch to 2 inch
slice. (If rolls are to be frozen for later use wait until they have
been thawed and warmed to glaze and decorate.)

White Wine Frosting: 2 Tbsp. soft butter 2 Tbsp. white wine 1 1/2 cup
powdered sugar 3 drops Waldmeister Essence* and a drop or tow of green
coloring or 1/4 tsp. Rose extract and a drop or two of red coloring

Beat butter, wine and sugar together until smooth. Add preferred
flavoring and carefully add the coloring for a very delicate tint.

Griddle Scones

breads

1 cup self-rising flour
1 pinch salt
3 tablespoon butter or margarine
2/3 cup currants
3/4 teaspoon groung nutmeg
1  egg
1/3 cup milk

Keywords: Scones, sugar free, bread

Preparation time  15 minutes, cooking time about 4 minutes per scone.

Mix the flour and salt together, and rub in the butter until the
mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.

Stir in the currants and nutmeg, then push the mixture gently to the
sides of the bowl to form a well in the center.

Beat together the egg and milk, and pour into the well in the center
of the flour.

Using a wooden spoon, mix the egg and milk mixture into the flour,
stirring from the center of the bowl and drawing the flour in from
the sides to form a smooth, thick batter. If batter is too thick, add
a little extra milk until it becomes a soft dropping consistency.

Heat a heavy-based frying pan on top of a moderate heat, and grease
with a little butter or oil.

Drop tablespoons of the batter into the hot pan, and cook for 2-3
minutes, or until the bases are set and have turned golden brown.

Turn the scones over and cook on the other side in the same way.

Serve from the pan with sugar-free preserves.

NOTE:  These scones freeze well, and can be re-heated by wrapping in a
clean dish towel and standing in a warm oven until they are heated
through.

Grilled Cardamom Nan Bread

breads

1  envelope active dry yeast
1 1/4 cup lukewarm water (110f-115f)
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon olive oil + extra
3 1/2 cup bread flour
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon ground cardamom

In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in the water and stir in the honey.
Let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add the 1 T oil, the flour,
salt and cardamom and stir until the dough forms a cohesive mass.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until
smooth and elastic, about 6 minutes. Divide the dough into 8 pieces
and shape each piece into a ball. Set the balls on an oiled baking
sheet and brush with oil.  Cover loosely with plastic and let rise in
a warm place until doubled in bulk, 1 to 2 hours. (Dough can be
refrigerated overnight - punch down balls before proceeding)

On a lightly floured surface, roll out each ball of dough to an 8-inch
disk.  Arrange them on 3 oiled baking sheets and let rest for 20
minutes.

Light a grill or heat a grill pan or cast-iron skillet. Brush each nan
lightly with olive oil and grill for about 1 minute, until golden on
the bottom and light bubbles form on the top. Turn and cook until
golden all over, about 1 minute.  Keep warm while you cook the
remaining nan.

Grissini Al Finocchio (Fennel Bread Sticks)

breads, herbs, italian

1 pkg active dry yeast
3/4 cup ; warm water (abt. 110 f.)
3/4 cup salad oil
3/4 cup beer
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon fennel seeds
4 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1  egg, beaten w/1 tb. water

In a large bowl, sprinkle yeast over warm water and let stand 5
minutes to soften.  Stir in salad oil, beer, salt and fennel seeds.
With a heavy-duty mixer or wooden spoon, beat in 3 1/2 c. flour until
dough is elastic (about 5 minutes).

On a board or pastry cloth, spread remaining 1 c. flour and turn out
dough. Knead, using this technique: lift edge of dough, coated well
with flour, and fold toward center, avoiding contact with sticky part
of dough. Continue folding toward center and kneading, turning dough
as you work, until it is smooth and elastic. Place dough in a greased
bowl; turn dough to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place
until doubled (1 to 1 1/4 hours).

On a floured surface, knead just to expel air.  Pinch off lumps (1
1/2" in diameter) and roll each into a strip that is 18" long. Cut
each strip in half.

Set wire racks on baking sheets and arrange strips across racks, 1/2"
apart.  Brush strips with egg-water mixture. Bake at 325 F. for about
35 minutes or until evenly browned. Serve hot, or cool on wire racks.

Half Moon Bay Pumpkin Bread

breads, quick bread

3 cup sugar, granulated
3 1/2 cup flour, all-purpose
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon nutmeg
4 large eggs
1 cup vegetable oil
2 cup pumpkin (cooked)
2/3 cup water
1 1/2 cup walnuts, chopped
1  cream cheese (optional; for serving)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Butter your containers well.

Sift the dry ingredients together into a large bowl.  Make a well in the
center of the dry ingredients, and add the eggs, oil, pumpkin and water.
Beat thoroughly. It's easier to get all the lumps out if you use an
electric mixer. Stir in the walnuts with a wooden spoon.

Pour the batter into the containers, filling each only half to two-thirds
full.  Bake for 60-90 minutes, depending on the sizes of your containers.
If you're using a very small container, start checking much sooner. The
bread is done when a toothpick in the middle comes out clean.

Cool about ten minutes, then loosen the edges of the bread with a knife,
and turn out of the pans to cool the rest of the way on a rack. For baking
containers, you can use a loaf pan, metal cans, or whatever. I usually use
1-pound coffee cans, and it takes three of them. If you want tiny loaves,
you could probably use soup cans.

NOTES:

*  A dessert bread made from pumpkins -- Every year in Half Moon Bay,
California there is a Pumpkin Festival, at which prizes are given for the
largest pumpkin in the world.  Never mind that  for the last two years the
winner has been in Nova Scotia:  the citizens of Half Moon Bay take
pumpkins very seriously.

At Christmas time in Half Moon Bay, people give each other little tins of
this bread as presents. I also take it backpacking, because it's pretty
resistant to being squashed (and tastes fine even when it is). Yield: 3
1-pound loaves.

*  I think the nuts are important in this recipe.  Unless you absolutely
hate them, leave them in.

*  It's not necessary, but you can serve some good cream cheese with it to
spread on the slices if you like.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.

Ham~ Cheese~ & Herb Baguette

breads, cheese/eggs, french

1 1/2 tablespoon active dry yeast
1 1/2 cup warm water
1 tablespoon honey
4 cup (approx.) unbleached white flour
1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)
4 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 cup cubed ham or pork
1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
2 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary or 1 tsp cru; mbled dried
2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme or 1 tsp crumbl; ed dried
2 teaspoon chopped fresh sage or 1 tsp crumble; d dried

...This French style loaf can be made from start to finish in a
little over an hour.  It's a hearty loaf that is delicious sliced and
lightly toasted and served with soups, stews, and salads...

generous grinding of black pepper

1.  Place the yeast in a large mixing bowl.  Mix in the warm water and
honey and set aside in a warm spot for about 10 minutes, or until the
yeast is dissolved and begins bubbling. (If the yeast does not bubble
it is probably dead. Begin again, using fresh yeast.) Gradually sift
the flour and salt into the yeast mixture, stirring constantly until
the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl.

2.  Sprinkle some flour over a working surface and gently knead the
dough for several minutes.  Cut the dough in half and roll out one
half into a rectangle (like a rectangular pizza) about 14 inches by
10 inches. Brush the dough with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the olive oil.
Scatter half the ham over the surface, pressing it gently into the
dough.. Sprinkle half the cheese on top and scatter half the herbs
and a generous grinding of fresh black pepper over the dough. Using
your hands, gently roll the dough lengthwise, into the shape of a
long cigar. Lightly seal the edges of the dough.  Place in a
well-greased French bread pan (or on a well-greased cookie sheet) and
cover with a clean tea towel.

3.  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

4.  Make the second loaf.  Place the two loaves of bread in a dry
warm spot and let the sit, covered, for
15    minutes.

5.  Just before baking, lightly brush the loaves with the remaining 1
tablespoon of olive oil.  Place in the middle shelf of the hot oven
and bake 20 to 25 minutes, or until the bread has a golden brown
crust and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.

Serves 8.  Makes 2 loaves.

1  friendship poem

FRIENDSHIP POEM:  "A penny for happy thoughts, Grains that grow and
nourish, Leavenings to lift us up, May friendship ever flourish."These
lovely friendship loaves were inspired by the "Begger's Rhyme" of
unknown origin..."Christmas is coming, the geese are getting fat,
plase put a penny in the old man's hat, If you haven't got a penny, a
ha'penny will do, If you haven't got a ha'penny--God Bless You!" This
special message to accompany your gift breads (the Friendship Poem),
is sure to spread the feeling of warm frienship and good will.I have
never tried this recipe. It comes from my "Pillsbury Festive Holiday
Recipes" cookbook, Classic #13. Marilyn Sultar

Hardee's Cinnamon "Flake" Biscuits

breads, desserts, biscuits

1  van geffen vghc42a
1  mixture
1  box kellogg's bran flakes --
1  (1 ounce) (1-serving
1  size)
1 tablespoon cinnamon
2 tablespoon brown sugar -- packed
2 tablespoon butter -- melted
1  biscuit dough
2 1/2 cup bisquick
2 tablespoon sugar
1/2 cup dark raisins
1/3 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup tonic water
1/2 teaspoon vanilla

MIXTURE-Empty the box of cereal into blender. Dump in cinnamon and
brown sugar and use high speed, on/off, for about 3 seconds or till
crumbled, but not powdered. Empty into small bowl. Stir in melted
butter with fork till mixture is completely softened. Set aside.
BISCUIT DOUGH-Use a 2-qt mixing bowl. Stir biscuick together with
sugar and raisins. Putbuttermilk, Tonic water and vanilla into
measuring cup, without stirring and pour into Bisquick mixture. Use
fork to mix until all of the liquid is absorbed. Then knead in the
bowl with hands, dipping into additional Bisquick, to make dough
smooth and no longer stick. Break dough up into 4 or 5 portions in
the bowl - sprinkling the "Flake" mixture over the dough and then
working it into your hands till most of it is pretty well evenly
distributed throughout the dough. You want more to "marbelize" the
dough than you do "mix"it into it. Divide dough into 12 equal parts
and shape each into 1/2" thick patty, arranging close togethe r in
Pam-sprayed 12" rouond or oven-proof skillet (or use 2 8" round layer
cake pans). Bake at 400~ for 25 minutes or until evenly golden.
Remove pan to wire rack and wipe tops with icing at once using the
following recipe. ICING-In small bowl with electric mixer on high
speed, beat 2 tb melted butter, 1 ts vanilla, 2 tb sour cream, dash
of salt and 1-1/2 c powdered sugar until smooth.Place a rounded tb of
icing atop each biscuit right out of the oven. The heat of the
biscuit will soften the icing just enough that you can swirl it
around to coat the tops nicely, letting the icing stand on thewarm
biscuits half a minute before spreading it. Refrigerate any leftover
icing in covered container to use within 2 weeks or freeze to use in
6 months.

Harriet's Southern Biscuits

breads

1 cup flour, plus 2 tablespoons
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
2 tablespoon crisco
1/2 cup buttermilk
1 tablespoon crisco, for frying pan

Mix the dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl. Blend in the Crisco
until the mixture is coarse and grainy. Harriet uses a fork, but I
have better luck with a pastry blender. Then, using a fork, stir in
the buttermilk.  Do not overmix.

Put on a floured board and knead just a few times. Pat out the dough
to about 1/2 inch thick.  Cut with a biscuit cutter or a glass.
(Flour the cutter.)  Do not handle the dough too much, or it will get
tough.

Use a heavy black frying pan.  Place the 1 tablespoon of Crisco in the
frying pan and put the frying pan in the over for about 7 minutes.
Remove the pan from the oven and place the biscuits in the pan. Turn
each once in the oil and bake the biscuits at 500 degrees for 10
minutes, or until light brown.

Hawaiian Bubble Bread

breads

2 pkg dry yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
1 cup warm water (105 degrees to 115 degr; ees)
1 cup sliced ripe banana
1/2 cup pineapple-orange-banana juice conce; ntrate, undiluted
1/4 cup honey
2 tablespoon margarine, melted
2 drop yellow food coloring (optional)
5 1/4 cup bread flour, divided
1 teaspoon salt
1  vegetable cooking spray
1/4 cup cream of coconut
2 tablespoon pineapple-orange-banana juice conce; ntrate, undiluted
1/2 cup sifted powdered sugar

1 Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water; let stand 5 minutes.

2 Combine banana and next 4 ingredients in a blender; process until
smooth, and set aside.

3 Combine 2 cups flour and salt in a large bowl; stir well. Add yeast
mixture and banana mixture, stirring until well-blended. Add 2-3/4
cups flour, stirring to form a soft dough.

4 Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface; knead until
smooth and elastic (about 8 minutes). Add enough of the remaining
flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, to prevent the dough from sticking to
hands.

5 Place dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to
coat top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from
drafts, 1-1/2 hours or until doubled in bulk. Punch dough down; turn
out onto a lightly floured surface, and let rest for 5 minutes. Form
the dough into 1-1/2-inch balls (about 30 balls) on a lightly floured
surface. Layer balls in a 10-inch tube pan coated with cooking spray;
set aside.

6 Combine the cream of coconut and 2 tablespoons juice in a bowl; stir
well. Pour 3 tablespoons juice mixture over dough, and set remaining
juice mixture aside. Cover dough, and let rise 1-1/2 hours or until
doubled in bulk.

7 Uncover dough, and bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until loaf
sounds hollow when tapped. Let cool in pan 20 minutes. Remove from
pan; place on a wire rack. Stir powdered sugar into remaining juice
mixture; drizzle over top of warm bread. Yield: 1 loaf, 26 servings.

1 tablespoon honey
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup lukewarm water
4 teaspoon dry yeast
3 tablespoon chopped parsley
2 tablespoon chopped fresh basil or 1 tsp. dried; , crushed basil
1 tablespoon freshly-snipped chives
1 teaspoon dried, crushed oregano
1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped thyme or 1/4 tsp. dri; ed thyme leaves
1/2 teaspoon freshly snipped marjoram or 1/4 tsp; . dried
4 1/2 cup rye flour
2 tablespoon oil

Combine skim milk powder and warm water in a small bowl, using a wire
whisk.  Add honey and salt.  In a larger mixing bowl, place the
lukewarm water and sprinkle the yeast over the top, until dissolved.
Add the milk mixture to the dissolved yeast.  Stir in the fresh and
dried herbs. Add two cups of rye flour. Beat for 2 minutes on medium
speed of electric mixer, scraping sides of bowl frequently; or beat
vigorously with a wooden spoon, about 200 strokes, until batter looks

cups of rye flour.

Scrape batter from sides of bowl.  Cover with a clean towel and set
in a warm place (85) away from drafts, to rise until light and
doubled in size--about 45 to 50 minutes. (Do not allow to over rise).
Stir the batter down.  Turn into a well-oiled one and one-half quart
casserole or souffle dish (batter will be sticky. Smooth out top of
loaf by flouring hand and patting into shape.)  Again, allow to rise
in a warm place, covered for 20 minutes.  Preheat oven to 375 F.

Place in preheated oven and bake for 45 to 50 minutes or until bread
is golden brown.  Remove from oven and brush top of bread lightly
with oil. Cool for 10 minutes. Turn bread out onto wire rack to cool.

Herbed Focaccia

breads, italian, processor

1 pkg dry yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
1 cup warm water (105-115f)
2 1/3 cup bread flour
1/3 cup cornmeal
1 1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup light-tasting olive oil
2 large garlic cloves; minced
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1  kosher salt
1 tablespoon fresh chives, snipped
1 tablespoon fresh parsley, minced
1 tablespoon red pepper flakes

A small amount of cornmeal gives this focaccia--a flat bread--a
perfect texture for improvised open sandwiches. You might start with
thinly sliced salami and cheese.

PREHEAT OVEN TO 450F. Fifteen minutes before baking focaccia, put
rack in center of oven. If you have 2 ovens, preheat both; otherwise
bake focaccias in sequence, one after the other. Generously oil 2
large baking sheets, preferably black steel. Stir yeast and sugar
into warm water. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Mix flour,
cornmeal and salt in food processor fitted with metal blade (can also
be kneaded with mixer dough hook or by hand). Turn on processor.
Slowly pour yeast mixture through feed tube. Also pour 2 tablespoons
oil through. Process until dough cleans inside of work bowl but is
still moist. If it sticks, add a little flour; if it's dry, add a
little water. Once dough is moist but not so wet that it sticks to
sides of bowl, process until uniformly kneaded, elastic and supple,
about 40 seconds. Transfer dough to large plastic food bag, squeeze
out air and seal at top, allowing room for dough to expand. Let dough
rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; use
immediately or refrigerate overnight. Combine remaining 6 tablespoons
oil, garlic and dried herbs. Gently heat until warm (not hot) on
stove top or microwave oven. Divide dough in half. Let rest 5
minutes. On floured board, roll each piece into about a 12-inch
round. Transfer to prepared baking sheets. Prick surface with fork.
Brush with oil mixture, including edges. Sprinkle with Kosher salt.
Bake, one at a time, until very lightly browned around edges only,
about 8-10 minutes. Do not overbake. Check after 2 minutes in oven;
prick any air pockets with fork. Brush with any remaining oil,
including edges. Sprinkle with fresh herbs and pepper flakes. Can be
baked in advance and frozen. To do so, cool completely, freeze and
then wrap airtight. Let thaw in wrapping. To reheat, place in cold
oven and set at 300F. Bake until hot, about 5-7 minutes. Cut into
wedges and serve hot. Yield: 2 12-inch rounds.

Herb-Oatmeal Bread (Clay-Pot)

breads

2 pkg active dry yeast
3 tablespoon honey
1 1/2 tablespoon salt
2 cup water
3/4 cup oatmeal; not instant
2 tablespoon sour cream
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon celery seeds
1 teaspoon poppy seeds
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1 tablespoon fresh sage; chopped
1 tablespoon fresh basil; chopped
1/2 teaspoon dill; dried
1  egg; beaten
2 tablespoon butter; melted
1/2 cup pine nuts
4 cup all-purpose flour

Combine the yeast, honey and salt with 1 cup lukewarm (not hot) water
and set aside. (Remember: if the water is too hot it will kill the
growing yeast.)

Heat 1 cup water to boiling, and add the oatmeal and sour cream.
Simmer, covered, for 10 minutes, then remove from the heat and cool
to lukewarm. Combine the whole-wheat flour, seeds, and herbs in a
large mixing bowl. Add the oatmeal and yeast mixtures and beat until
well blended. Add beaten egg and melted butter and beat several times
again. Add the pine nuts, then add 3 cups of the all-purpose flour,
one cup at a time, beating between each addition until a fairly stiff
dough is developed.

Spread the remaining all-purpose flour on a board and knead the dough
into it thoroughly, about a dozen times, then put the dough in a
large, well-greased bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Set to rise in
a warm place until double its original bulk (about 1 hour).

Just before the end of the rising time, presoak 2 clay pots, top and
bottom, in hot water for 15 minutes. (We use 2 pots in order to bake
each loaf separately.)

Place the risen dough on a floured board, divide, and shape into 2
loaves. Before putting the loaves in the presoaked pots, put a small
piece of aluminum foil, just large enough to cover the bottom of the
loaf, on the bottom of each pot. (This keeps the bread from sticking
to the pot.) Place the dough inside the pots, cover, and allow to
rise until almost doubled in bulk (about 45 minutes). (I wrapped the
pot in a wet towel to keep it from drying out too soon.)

Cover the pots and put them in a cold oven.

Set the oven temperature at 480 degrees. Bake for 40 minutes. If
necessary, remove lid for the last 5 minutes of baking to get a
golden brown crust.

Source: "The Clay-Pot Cookbook" by Georgia MacLeod Sales and Grover
Sales

NOTE: This is the best bread I've made in a long time. High loaf,
light, and with a very crisp crust and moist inside. Pine nuts don't
add much to it and could be left out. Had a problem with it sticking
to the pot (my clay pot has a semi-glazed bottom which I greased very
lightly with shortening, and it still stuck in spots).

Here's A Bagel Recipe

breads

6 cup (to 8c) bread (high-gluten) flour
4 tablespoon dry baking yeast
6 tablespoon granulated white sugar or light hon; ey (clover honey is good)
2 teaspoon salt
3 cup hot water
1  a bit of vegetable oil
1  gallon water
5 tablespoon malt syrup or sugar
1  a few handfuls of cornmeal
1  large mixing bowl
1  wire whisk
1  measuring cups and spoons
1  wooden mixing spoon
1  butter knife or baker's dough blade
1  clean, dry surface for kneading
1  3 clean, dry kitchen towels
1  warm, but not hot, place to set dou; gh to rise
1  large stockpot
1  slotted spoon
1  2 baking sheets

First, pour three cups of hot water into the mixing bowl. The water
should be hot, but not so hot that you can't bear to put your fingers
in it for several seconds at a time. Add the sugar or honey and stir
it with your fingers (a good way to make sure the water is not too
hot) or with a wire whisk to dissolve. Sprinkle the yeast over the
surface of the water, and stir to dissolve.

Wait about ten minutes for the yeast to begin to revive and grow.
This is known as "proofing" the yeast, which simply means that you're
checking to make sure your yeast is viable. Skipping this step could
result in your trying to make bagels with dead yeast, which results
in bagels so hard and potentially dangerous that they are banned
under the terms of the Geneva Convention.  You will know that the
yeast is okay if it begins to foam and exude a sweetish, slightly
beery smell.

At this point, add about three cups of flour as well as the 2 tsp of
salt to the water and yeast and begin mixing it in. Some people
subscribe to the theory that it is easier to tell what's going on
with the dough if you use your hands rather than a spoon to mix
things into the dough, but others prefer the less physically direct
spoon. As an advocate of the bare-knuckles school of baking, I
proffer the following advice: clip your fingernails, take off your
rings and wristwatch, and wash your hands thoroughly to the elbows,
like a surgeon. Then you may dive into the dough with impunity.  I
generally use my right hand to mix, so that my left is free to add
flour and other ingredients and to hold the bowl steady. Left-handed
people might find that the reverse works better for them. Having one
hand clean and free to perform various tasks works best.

When you have incorporated the first three cups of flour, the dough
should begin to become thick-ish. Add more flour, a half-cup or so at
a time, and mix each addition thoroughly before adding more flour. As
the dough gets thicker, add less and less flour at a time. Soon you
will begin to knead it by hand (if you're using your hands to mix the
dough in the first place, this segue is hardly noticeable).  If you
have a big enough and shallow enough bowl, use it as the kneading
bowl, otherwise use that clean, dry, flat countertop or tabletop
mentioned in the "Equipment" list above. Sprinkle your work surface
or bowl with a handful of flour, put your dough on top, and start
kneading. Add bits of flour if necessary to keep the dough from
sticking (to your hands, to the bowl or countertop, etc....). Soon
you should have a nice stiff dough. It will be quite elastic, but
heavy and stiffer than a normal bread dough. Do not make it too dry,
however... it should still give easily and stretch easily without
tearing.

Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, and cover with one of your
clean kitchen towels, dampened somewhat by getting it wet and then
wringing it out thoroughly. If you swish the dough around in the
bowl, you can get the whole ball of dough covered with a very thin
fil of oil, which will keep it from drying out.

Place the bowl with the dough in it in a dry, warm (but not hot)pace,
free from drafts.  Allow it to rise until doubled in volume. Some
people try to accelerate rising by putting the dough in the oven,
where the pilot lights keep the temperature slightly elevated. If
it's cold in your kitchen, you can try this, but remember to leave
the oven door open or it may become too hot and begin to kill the
yeast and cook the dough. An ambient temperature of about 80 degrees
Farenheit (25 centigrades) is ideal for rising dough.

While the dough is rising, fill your stockpot with about a gallon of
water and set it on the fire to boil. When it reaches a boil, add the
malt syrup or sugar and reduce the heat so that the water just barely
simmers; the surface of the water should hardly move. Submitted By

Here's A Bagel Recipe #2

breads

1 x no ingredients

Once the dough has risen, turn it onto your work surface, punch it
down, and divide immediately into as many hunks as you want to make
bagels. For this recipe, you will probably end up with about 15
bagels, so you will divide the dough into 15 roughly even-sized
hunks. Begin forming the bagels. There are two schools of thought on
this. One method of bagel formation involves shaping the dough into a
rough sphere, then poking a hole through the middle with a finger and
then pulling at the dough around the hole to make the bagel. This is
the hole-centric method. The dough-centric method involves making a
long cylindrical "snake" of dough and wrapping it around your hand
into a loop and mashing the ends together. Whatever you like to do is
fine. DO NOT, however, give in to the temptation of using a doughnut
or cookie cutter to shape your bagels. This will pusht them out of
the realm of Jewish Bagel Authenticity and give them a distinctly
Protestant air. The bagels will not be perfectly shaped. They will
not be symmetrical. This is normal. This is okay. Enjoy the
diversity. Just like snowflakes, no two genuine bagels are exactly
alike.

Begin to preheat the oven to 400 degrees Farenheit.

Once the bagels are formed, let them sit for about 10 minutes. They
will begin to rise slightly.  Ideally, they will rise by about
one-fourth volume... a technique called "half-proofing" the dough. At
the end of the half-proofing, drop the bagels into the simmering
water one by one. You don't want to crowd them, and so there should
only be two or three bagels simmering at any given time.  The bagels
should sink first, then gracefully float to the top of the simmering
water. If they float, it's not a big deal, but it does mean that
you'll have a somewhat more bready (and less bagely) texture.  Let
the bagel simmer for about three minutes, then turn them over with a
skimmer or a slotted spoon. Simmer another three minutes, and then
lift the bagels out of the water and set them on a clean kitchen
towel that has been spread on the countertop for this purpose. The
bagels should be pretty and shiny, thanks to the malt syrup or sugar
in the boiling water.

Once all the bagels have been boiled, prepare your baking sheets by
sprinkling them with cornmeal.  Then arrange the bagels on the
prepared baking sheets and put them in the oven. Let them bake for
about 25 mintues, then remove from the oven, turn them over and put
them back in the oven to finish baking for about ten minutes more.
This will help to prevent flat-bottomed bagels.

Remove from the oven and cool on wire racks, or on a dry clean towels
if you have no racks.  Do not attempt to cut them until they are
cool... hot bagels slice abominably and you'll end up with a wadded
mass of bagel pulp. Don't do it.

Serve with good cream cheese.

TO CUSTOMIZE BAGELS: After boiling but before baking, brush the
bagels with a wash made of 1 egg white and 3 tablespoons ice water
beaten together. Sprinkle with the topping of your choice: poppy,
sesame, or caraway seeds, toasted onion or raw garlic bits, salt or
whatever you like. Just remember that bagels are essentially a savory
baked good, not a sweet one, and so things like fruit and sweet
spices are really rather out of place. Submitted By

Herman Sourdough Starter

breads

2 cup all-purpose flour
2 cup milk
1 cup sugar
1/3 cup warm water (115-120degrees)
2 pkg dry yeast

Sprinkle 1 Tablespoon of the sugar over the warm water.  Sprinkle
yeast over this and let stand in warm place to double in size,
approximately 10 minutes.

Mix milk, sugar, flour and yeast mixture in a plastic or glass
container, about the size of a 5 quart ice cream bucket.

Stir, using only a wooden spoon as metal objects retard Herman's
natural growth.  Cover loosely with a clean cloth or place glass
plate over top of container so Herman can breathe.

Herman doubles, even triples at times of vigorous rising.  Place
Herman in a warm place overnight. (On top of refrigerator or in oven
with only the pilot light or electric oven light on.) Next day
refrigerate, loosely covered, and try to stir each day.  Yeast-type
mold may begin to form on the surface after 48 hours if you don't
stir daily.  On the fifth day, measure out 1 cup of Herman to bake
with (you can measure out more but you must have at least 1 cup of
Herman left).  Then feed the Herman you have left:
1 c all-purpose white flour; 1 c milk; 1/2 c sugar

Stir well!  Keep in refrigerator in the same large container, loosely
covered.  Stir every day.  We have been away on vacation weekends
with no stirring and Herman survived quite nicely.  For longer
vacations, remember he freezes well!

On the tenth day, if you wish, measure out enough to bake another
recipe and start the process of feeding him once again.  Feed Herman:

2 c all-purpose flour; 2 cups milk; 1 cup sugar

After the tenth day we start using Herman almost daily, or as
desired, as we make most of our bread, cake and pancakes from Herman.
As long as we remember to feed him approximately every 5 days he
survives very well. Feed on days divisible by five-five, ten,
fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, and thirty.  You will never again
forget when to feed Herman.  If it's a 5-day, feed Herman!

If you are not using Herman often, just add a Tablespoon of sugar to
Herman every fifth day and continue as long as forever!!  Herman is
such a sweetheart ( a sweet sourdough)!!

Herman Sourdough Starter   #2

breads

2 cup milk
2 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar
1 pkg dry yeast, dissolved in 1/4 cup war; m water

1.  In a large glass or ceramic bowl, combine 1 cup of the milk, 1
cup of the flour, the sugar and the dissolved yeast. Using a non-
metal spoon, beat until smooth and creamy. Stir in the remaining 1
cup milk and 1 cup flour.  Cover with a clean kitchen towel and set
in a moderately warm spot (about 70F.)  Let stand for 24 hours, at
which point the batter should smell pleasantly sour. 2. Transfer to a
tightly covered glass or plastic container and place in the
refrigerator. Stir with a nonmetal spoon once a day for 5 days. 3. To
use the starter, measure out what you need and let it come to room
temperature. Replenish it with equal parts of flour and milk, plus
half a part of sugar. (For example, if you remove 1 cup of starter,
stir in 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup milk, and 1/4 cup sugar.) The starter
may be stored in the refrigerator indefinitely, but flavor develops
best when batter is used and replenished often.

Cover partially(tilt lid or punch holes in plastic cover);
refrigerate. Makes about 1 1/2 to 2 cups starter, depending on
thickness. It can be creamy or as thick as dough because of room
conditions, the age of "Herman" and other variables.

THE FLAVOR OF THIS STARTER EVOLVES AS IT AGES-MILDLY SWEET WHEN
YOUNG, MORE LIKE SOURDOUGH WHEN OLDER.

Herman is replenished only after you use it. If that is going to be
longer than 14 days, then put it in the freezer until ready to use.

Herman Starter *

breads

      ----I.E.S.JJGF65A----
      ----PHILLY.INQUIRER----
2 tablespoon or 2 envelopes active dry
1  yeast
1/4 cup warm water
1 cup sugar
2 cup all purpose white flour
2 cup milk (see note)

DAY,1: Sprinkle yeast over warm water.Add 1 tablespoon of the sugar
and let stand a few minutes until yeast is active and swelling.Combine
remaining sugar,flour and milk in a 4 t0 6 quart glass,plastic or
pottery bowl or container.(Do not use metal bowls or utensils as
these may retard starter growth.)With a wooden spoon,stir in active
yeast mixture.Cover loosely with a towel so Herman can breathe.Let
stand in a warm draft free place overnight.
DAYS,2,3,and 4:Stir daily with a wooden spoon.Keep covered.Keep
cool.
DAY,5: Stir in 1/2 cup sugar,1 cup milk and 1 cup flour.Let stand 24
hours.
DAYS,6,7,8,and 9:Stir daily with a wooden spoon.
DAY,10: Repeat DAY 5,stirring in 1/2 cup sugar,1 cup milk and 1 cup
flour.
THIS gives you enough starter to use freely in recipes and/or give
away. Herman may be replenished as needed but can go no more than 5
days at room temperature between feedings.After feeding,wait 24 hours
before using the renewed starter.
DAILY stirring helps keep yeast mold from forming.
Most directions specify that Herman not be refrigerated since cooler
temperatures slow the growth and "souring" of the starter.It
is,however,a safer course for busy cooks with fast growing
startersHerman also is freezer-friendly and may be kept on ice
between baking impulses if you get board.
NOTE: If desired,substitute butter-milk for milk in starter for more
flavor and less fat.If more starter is needed,additions may be
doubled when 2 or more cups of starter are used.....

Herman Starter White Bread

breads

1 1/2 cup milk
2 tablespoon solid vegetable shortening
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pkg dry yeast, dissolved in 1/4 warm wa; ter
1 cup herman sourdough starter at room te; mperature
5  to 6 cups bread flour

makes two 9x5 inch loaves

1.  In a wide saucepan, combine the milk, shortening, sugar, and salt.
Place over medium heat and stir until the shortening is melted.
Transfer to a large mixing bowl to cool.

2.  When the mixture is barely warm to the touch, stir in the
dissolved yeast.  Blend in the sourdough starter. Add 2 cups of the
flour and beat with a spoon until smooth. Gradually blend in
additional flour until the dough becomes too difficult to stir. turn
out onto a floured surface and knead in as much of the remaining
flour as necessary to form a cohesive dough.  Continue kneading in
flour until the dough is soft yet no longer sticks to the work
surface. Transfer to a greased bowl and cover with a clean kitchen
towel. Set aside to rise until double in bulk.

3.  Generously grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans.  Punch the dough down,
then turn it out onto a floured surface. Shape it into 2 loaves and
place them in the prepared pans. Cover and set aside to rise. When
double in bulk, bake in a preheated 375 oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or
until the crust is nicely browned. Cool on a rack for 5 minutes, then
turn out. Complete cooling on the rack.

Herman Wheat'n'honey Starter B/M

breads

1/2 cup honey; or brown sugar
1/3 cup warm water
2 tablespoon yeast
2 cup milk
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup white flour; or unbleached
1 tablespoon ginger
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup white flour; or unbleached
1/4 cup honey; or brown sugar 1/4 t

Stir well. Keep in refrigerator. Sprinkle ginger and 1 T. honey or
brown sugar over warm water. Sprinkle yeast over this and stir. Let
stand in warm place to double in size, about 10 minutes. Mix milk,
rest of honey or brown sugar, flours & yeast mixture in a glass
container, about the size of a gallon Pyrex jar. Stir, using only a
wooden spoon, since metal objects will retard Herman's growth. Leave
the cover on loosely or place a glass plate over the top of the
container so Herman can breathe. Herman doubles, even triples at time
of vigorous rising. Place Herman in a warm place overnight. Next day
refrigerate, loosely covered, and stir each day. This is very
important with Wheat'n'Honey Herman Starter as more gases form in the
container and are released during stirring. Formation of this gas may
cause the starter to appear darker on top before stirring each day,
but this is OK. On the 5th day measure out 1 c. Herman for baking and
another cup to give to a friend, if you wish, then feed the Herman
you have left, thusly: SEE ABOVE From day 5 on you may bake with
Herman any day you wish, always making sure you have one full cup
left for feeding. Feed Herman every five days. If you have a lot
left, feed him only 1 T. honey or brown sugar. If you have one cup or
a little more left, add the same ingredients as you did on the 5th
day. When you share a cup of Herman with friends they should feed
Herman the same way. From News & Observer, Raleigh, N.C. 10/17/90

Highland Oatcakes

breads, ethnic

8 oz medium oatmeal
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 oz dripping or lard
3 tablespoon hot water (or more)

Sift salt and oatmeal in a roomy bowl.  Put on the gridle or a heavy
frying pan to heat.  Bring the water to the boil with the fat. Pour
into a well in the oatmeal. Work into a stiff dough and cut in half.
Roll out on a floured board to the size of a dinner plate and about
1/8-inch thick. Cut into quarters or farles.

Test the gridle's heat by holding your hand over it. Lay on one of the
quartered rounds.  When the farles are ready, the surface stops
steaming and begins to look dry and white. Turn them and do the other
side. Dry off the oatcakes and lightly brown the edges in a hot oven
or under the grill - they should curl up to the fire to prove that
you have made your own.

Homade Pita Bread

breads

1 cup water
1 cup apple juice
1 1/2 tablespoon yeast, active dry
1/2 teaspoon salt
5 cup whole wheat flour
6 teaspoon whole-wheat gluten (opt)
1  yellow cornmeal

1. In saucepan, combine water and apple juice and heat just until
warm (about 115 deg). Put warm liquid in large mixing bowl, sprinkle
yeast over liquid and allow to dissolve. Add 2 cups flour and the 6
eeaspoons whole-wheat gluten flour, if desired; beat at medium speed
of electric mixer for 3 minutes. Cover and let rise in warm place
until doubled in size, about 20 min.

2. Add salt, beat in as much flour as can be beaten vigorously by
hand for 6 minutes. Mix as much remaining flour as can be handled
when mixing by hand and enough so that dough can be removed from bowl
onto floured surface.  Cover with a towel and let rest for
10    min.

3. Knead gently and rhythmically for 10-15 minutes.
Keeping dough rolled in a ball. add the remaining flour, a little at
a time, kneading after each addition. Be careful not to add too much
flour, or the bread will be dry. Keep dough slightly sticky to the
touch. Cover with a towel and let rest 10 minutes.

4. At this point, the dough may be shaped into pita bread. loaves of
bread, pizza dough, buns, etc.  to make pitas, cut dough in half with
lightly floured hands, roll each half into rope 2 1/2 inches in
diameter. Cut each roll into pieces and roll with hands into 2 to 3
inch balls, depending on the desired size of pocked bread.

5. Place each dough ball on flat surface and with a lightly floured
rolling pin, roll out from center until dough forms a circle 1/4 inch
thick.  Gently dip bottom of dough in cornmeal and place on back of
cookie sheet.  Cover with a towel and let rise at room tempeerature
for 15 minutes.

6. The best way to bake pitas is on flat quarry tiles, which can be
purchased at any rock and stone outlet.
A cast ironskillet turned upside down also works well, but limits
you to making one pita at a time.  A thrid option, less satisfactory
than the others but still workable, is a cookie sheet turned upside
down.

7. Place one of the three items mentioned above in the oven and
preheat to 500 degrees.  Remove top oven rack for convenience in
removing pitas later.

8. Gently but quickly slip a raised pita onto a spatula and place it
on the hot tile, skillet or cookie sheet. Once it touches the hot
surface, you cannot move it, so aim carefull. Repeat with as many
pitas as your baking method will accomodate.  Close oven and bake for
3-4 minutes or until lightly browned. If your baking the pitas on a
cookie sheet you may see very few or perhaps no bubbles appear - do
not overcook just because bubbles are small and not uniform. If
you're using tiles or a cast iron skillet, you will be able to watch
pockets form immediately.

9. Remove pitas carefully from oven with spatula and place on cooling
rack. Cut each pita in half while still warm. If difficult to cut.
Place pita in a damp towel for 5 minutes, and then it will cut nicely.

Home Made Bread

breads, low fat

1 1/2 lb strong [bread] flour, either
1  white or wholemeal
1  [wholewheat]
1  as preferred
1/2 pkg instant dried yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
1 large pinch salt
1  warm water to mix

Mix flour, yeast, salt and sugar, then add enough water to make a
fairly firm dough.  Knead vigorously until dough is smooth and
elastic - you can do this in a food processor, but it is very
therapeutic to do it by hand! Place in a clean bowl, cover, and leave
in a warm place for about an hour, or until doubled in size. Knead
again, then place on a greased, floured oven-proof plate.  Cover, if
possible with an oven- proof bowl, and leave for ten-fifteen minutes.

Bake in a hot oven (mark 7, 200 C, 425 F) for about 40 minutes, or
until it sounds hollow when tapped underneath. This doesn't keep well
as it has no fat, but that is seldom a problem!

Homemade Hamburger Buns

breads

1  stephen ceideburg
3 cup all-purpose flour + additional for; kneading
2 cup whole-wheat flour
1/3 cup toasted wheat germ
2 pkg active dry yeast
2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup solid vegetable shortening
2 cup milk
1/4 cup sugar

Place 1 1/2 cups each, all-purpose flour and whole-wheat flour, the
wheat germ, yeast and salt in a large bowl. Using an electric mixer
(preferably a heavy-duty one with a paddle attachment), briefly mix
together the ingredients.

Melt the shortening in a saucepan over low heat. Add the milk and
sugar and heat until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is very
warm, but no hotter than 130 degree F.

With the mixer on low speed, slowly pour milk mixture into flour
mixture until blended. Increase to medium speed and beat for about 2
minutes.

Add 1/2 cup each of white flour and whole-wheat flour, and beat 2
minutes more. Add 1 cup white flour and beat until dough pulls away
from sides of bowl.

Knead dough on a lightly floured surface about 8 minutes, or until
smooth and elastic. (Use very little additional flour.)

Place in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set aside to rise in a
warm place until double in volume, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

Gently punch down dough and divide into 4 equal portions. Divide each
portion into fourths and let dough rest 5 minutes.

Form portions into balls and with fingertips fold edges under to form
even circles. Place on lightly greased baking sheets, about 2 inches
apart. Use your fingertips to flatten each bun to a 3-inch circle.
(If you prefer the sides of the buns to remain soft, place them
closer together. As the buns rise, the sides will touch.)

Cover with a towel and set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour.

Adjust rack in lower third of oven; preheat oven to 350 degrees F. at
least 20 minutes before baking.

Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until buns are golden and sound hollow
when tapped lightly. Cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.
(Or cool and freeze, well wrapped, for up to 1 week.)

Makes 16

Hot dog buns. Divide dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, pat
or roll out each portion to a rectangle about 14 x 5 inches. Cut
about eight 5 x 2-inch strips from each rectangle. Roll each portion,
between your palms into 6-inch long buns. Place buns about 2 inches
apart on lightly greased baking sheets. Cover loosely with a cloth
towel and set aside in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake
as directed for hamburger, buns.

Variation Wheat berry: Add 1/3 cup wheat berries and a dash of salt
to 2 cups boiling water. Cover saucepan and simmer for 20 minutes.
Remove from heat, cover, and let cool for about 1 1/2 hours, or until
tender. Drain and dry well. With wooden spoon, stir wheat berries
into dough before kneading,

Variation Walnut: Toast 1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts in a 325
degree F. oven about 10 minutes. Cool and with a wooden spoon stir
into dough before kneading.

Variation Olive: Coarsely chop 1/3 cup pitted oil or brine- cured
black or green olives. With wooden spoon (or paddle attachment and
mixer at low speed) stir olives into dough before kneading.

Variation Sesame seed: After shaping buns, lightly brush tops with an
egg white lightly beaten with 1 teaspoon water. Sprinkle sesame seeds
over glaze. Cover lightly with a towel and let rise before baking.

Homemade Mexican Bolillos

breads

1  stephen ceideburg
2 2/3 cup warm water (110 degrees f.)
1 pkg active dry yeast
1/2 teaspoon sugar
6 1/2 cup unbleached bread flour + more for k; neading
1 tablespoon butter, melted
1/2 cup dry milk powder
2 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 tablespoon salt
2 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoon vegetable oil
1/2 cup warm water mixed with
2 teaspoon salt

This recipe is the closest I have come to the real bolillos of
Mexico. The secret ingredient is the cinnamon, which provides that
elusive Mexican taste.

Pour 2/3 cup of the water into a small bowl. Add yeast and 1/2
teaspoon sugar. Let proof about 10 minutes until bubbly.

Combine yeast mixture and remaining water in a large bowl. Whisk in 3
cups of the flour. Set in a warm place for 30 minutes.

Stir in butter, milk powder, sugar, cinnamon, salt and baking powder.
Stir in remaining flour; turn out on a lightly floured board and
knead for 10 minutes, adding additional flour, if necessary. Coat
dough with oil and return to bowl. Let rise until doubled in bulk,
about 1 hour.

Pour the salt-water mixture into a spray bottle.

Punch down dough and form into oblong rolls about 4 inches long. Each
bolillo should weigh about 4 ounces. Place on lightly greased baking
sheets that have been dusted with cornmeal. Let rise about 30
minutes, or until doubled. Slash tops lengthwise and mist gently with
the salty water.

Bake in a preheated 375 degree F. oven for 10 minutes. Mist again.
Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. and bake 25 minutes longer,
until rolls are golden brown.

Makes 12 bolillos.

Homemade Pan Bread With Fresh Herbs

breads, italian, spices

2 cup warm water
1 tablespoon dry yeast
3 tablespoon sugar
6 cup to 7 c all purpose flour
1 tablespoon salt
1/2 cup olive oil
1 tablespoon dry italian seasonings
2 tablespoon minced fresh garlic
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil leaves
2 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano

From Sheryl Benesch, Korbel Champagne Cellars.

This pan bread has an Italian heritage.  It does not need butter and
is best eaten shortly after it has emerged from the oven. It is
excellent with vegetable soups.

Combine the waterm, yeast, sugar, and approximately 2 cups of the
flour to make a thick paste.  Mix thoroughly and let stand a few
minutes until bubbles rise to the surface.

Combine the salt with the remaining flour; add gradually to the yeast
mixture, until it will absorb no more flour. Knead the dough until the
texture is smooth and not sticky to the touch; about 5 to 10 minutes.
Place the dough in an oiled bowl and let it rise in a warm place
until it has doubled in bulk. Punch dough down, place on a lightly
floured surface, and knead for another minute. Let dough rest for 5 to
10    minutes.

Brush a 9 x 13 inch sheet pan with 1/3 of the olive oil. Sprinkle the
pan with 1/2 tablespoon of the dry Italian seasonings and 1
tablespoon of garlic.  Roll the bread dough out to line the pan.

Lay the dough into the pan, brush with the remaining olive oil,
sprinkle with the remaining garlic and Italian seasonings, and then
the fresh herbs. (At this point the bread may be prepared a day ahead
and kept in the refrigerator, on the prepared pan, to rise.)

Let the dough rise for about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Bake in a
preheated 350 degrees F oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden
brown.

Serves 8 to 12.

Homemade Water Crackers

breads

2 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup solid vegetable shortening
10 tablespoon cold water
2 tablespoon sesame seeds
1  kosher salt

Combine salt, baking powder and flour in a food processor. Process
very briefly just to mix. Place shortening on top of flour mixture.
Process again until shortening disappears into the mixture. Start
processing and gradually add the water, incorporating only enough to
make a firm dough that gathers into a ball. Knead the dough briefly
on a work surface just until cohesive. Wrap in plastic wrap and let
rest 15 minutes. Adjust rack to lower third of oven; preheat to 350øF.

Divide the dough into half. On a lightly floured surface, roll out
each half to a 1/8" (or thinner) thickness; prick the pastry all over
with the tines of a fork. Cut out dough with a 2" round cutter;
sprinkle lightly with seeds and Kosher salt, if desired. Arrange the
crackers on lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheets. Bake 10
minutes, then turn crackers over and bake an additional 3-4 minutes,
or until light golden and crisp. Cool crackers on a wire rack. Store
in airtight tins.

Honey Almond Whole Wheat Bread

breads

1 cup whole blanched almonds
2  cakes or packets (6 0z ea)
1  active yeast
1 cup warm water (80-85 degrees)
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/3 cup honey
2  eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter, melted
2 teaspoon grated orange rind
1/2 cup buttermilk or sour milk
2 cup whole wheat flour, unsifted
2 1/2 cup white flour, unsifted
1  brown sugar filling

Chop almonds. Note, that other nuts can be substituted. Crumble yeast
if in cake form) or packets and add into warm water and stir until
dissolved. Stir in brown sugar and honey. Stir in eggs, salt, melted
butter, orange rind and buttermilk (or sour milk). Mix all flours
with all but 2 tablespoons of nuts; stir into liquid mixture. Let
this very soft dough rest for 10 minutes.

Scrape dough onto board or pastry cloth dusted with about 1/2 cup of
additional all-purpose flour. Knead for about 5 minutes, working in
flour on the board, until dough is elastic but still soft and tender.

Place dough in greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in
a warm place about 2 1/2 hours, or until doubled in bulk. (A turned
off oven with the light on is a good place.)

Turn dough onto floured board again; gently pat into a 12x10 inch
rectangle. Sprinkle Brown sugar filling over dough and roll up from
the 10 inch side. Fold two ends under to make a ball-shaped loaf and
place on a greased baking sheet. Brush with melted butter.

Fold a 36 inch piece of foil to make a 2 inch wide strip 36 inches
long. Fasten with paper clips into a ring and set ring around the
dough. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm oven
until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Sprinkle loaf with remaining

Hot Cheese Toast

appetizers, breads, cheese, cocktails

8 slice bacon; cooked; crumbled
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1 cup shredded sharp cheddar
1  cheese
1 small onion; grated
1  egg; lightly beaten
1  freshly ground pepper
1/8 teaspoon dry mustard
1/2 teaspoon worcestershire sauce
1  several dashes tabasco sauce
8 slice firm white day-old bread

Cook bacon by placing on a rack over a shallow pan and bake at 350
degrees for about 20 minutes, or until crisp. Drain on paper towels
and set aside.

Combine all ingredients except bread in a bowl. Crumble bacon and add
to mixture; set aside.

Cut crusts from bread slices and toast on both sides. Spread each
slice generously with cheese mixture; then cut each slice into three
long strips. Sprinkle with paprika; place on baking sheet, cover with
waxed paper and refrigerate.  This may be done the day before. Remove
from refrigerator 30 minutes before ready to bake; bake at 350
degrees for about 20 minutes, or until light brown and puffy.  Serve
hot. Double the recipe for a cocktail party of 20.

Note:  These strips are quite filling.  For a daintier appetizer, cut
strips in half before baking.  These are delicious nd versatile,
providing a good luncheon or brunch dish. They should be served with
sliced tomatoes and garnished with parsley clusters; in which case,
serve two whole bread slices per person, not cutting into strips. MM

brown. Remove buns from oven and slide off pan on to wire rack over
sheet of waxed paper.

GLAZE: Whisk lemon juice and icing sugar together to form a runny bu
slightly thickened mixture, rather like skim milk in color and
translucence (glaze should not be so thick that it makes a white
coating, hiding the cross). Brush glaze over buns while they're still
hot (some icing will drip on to the waxed paper). If desired, wait 5
minutes, then brush on a second coat of glaze.

SPICE BLENDS: Just mix ingredients together and use as per recipe.

FROZEN DOUGH METHOD: With rolling pin, press dough into a large
rectangle. Sprinkle with raisins. Starting at long side, roll dough
tightly into a log shape. Slice log into 9 sections.
Form each section into a ball and place in square pan coated with non
stick spray. Cover with sprayed plastic wrap and allow to double in
size. Remove plastic wrap and bake at 350 F for 20 minutes or until
golden brown. Remove immediately to cooling rack.

TO MAKE ICING: Mix all icing ingredients together and place in a
squeeze bottle, icing bag or gun.
When buns are cool, use icing bag or snipped milk bag to squirt
icing in a cross design on top.

1 cup raisins
      ----ICING----
1 cup icing sugar
1 tablespoon butter, soft
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
2 tablespoon to 3 tb milk

* : Use either spice mixture for the recipe, not both.

Heat water to just warmer than a baby bottle, but not hot (about 105
F). Disolve sugar in water, then sprinkle yeast on top and let stand
for 10 minutes until foamy. In a small bowl, warm milk and honey to
same temperature. Whisk in the oil, egg and egg whites.
In a large bowl, mix together the milk powder, whole-wheat flour, 1
cup of the all-purpose flour, salt, spice blend (only one of them),
raisins, currants and peel. Make a well in the centre of the dry
ingredients and stir in yeast and milk mixtures.
Gradually add 1 - 1 1/2 cups more all-purpose flour. When dough
comes away from the sides pf the bowl, turn dough on to floured
surface and knead for 10 minutes. Add more flour as needed to form an
elastic dough. If raisins or peel pop out of the dough as you knead,
just poke them back in and continue kneading.
Lightly grease a bowl. Shape dough into a ball and place in greased
bowl, turning to coat the ball with grease. Cover loosely with a tea
towel and let rise until doubled in size, abt 1.5 hours.
Punch dough down and knead into a ball.
Divide dough into 20 equal parts. By repeatedly tucking the sides
under and pressing up with your thumb, shape the 20 pieces of dough
into tight round balls and place on a well greased baking sheet.
Cover loosely with a tea towel and let rise until doubled in size,
abt 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375 F. Just before baking and adding
cross, gently brush tops of buns with ligthly beaten egg white.

Hot Cross Buns With Cream Cheese Frosting

breads, easter

5 cup all-purpose flour
2 pkg active dry yeast
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/4 teaspoon cloves
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1 1/4 cup milk
1/2 cup butter (1 stick)
2  eggs, beaten
3/4 cup currants or raisins
1/3 cup candied orange peel (opt)
1  egg yolk mixed with
2 tablespoon water
      ----CREAM CHEESE FROSTING----
3 oz cream cheese, softened
1 cup confectioner's sugar
1 teaspoon milk

Combine 2 cups of flour, yeast, sugar, salt and spices in a large
mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, heat milk and butter to very warm
(120 to 130ø). Add to flour. Beat on medium speed of mixer for 1
minute. Add eggs. Beat another minute. Stir in currants, orange peel
and enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle. Turn dough
out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic,
about 5 minutes, adding additional flour as needed. Place in a
buttered bowl, turning to butter top. Cover; let rise in warm place
until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Punch down dough; turn onto
lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half; divide each half into
9 pieces. Form each piece into a smooth round ball. Place balls of
dough in two buttered 8-inch square baking pans. Cover; let rise in
warm place until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Brush
lightly with egg yolk mixture. Bake rolls in preheated 375ø oven, 20
to 25 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from pans. Cool on wire
rack. Prepare Cream Cheese Frosting. Drizzle frosting across the top
of each bun in the shape of a cross. Makes 18 buns. CREAM CHEESE
FROSTING: Beat cream cheese and sugar in a bowl until smooth. Add up
to 1 teaspoon of milk for drizzling consistency.

Note: Hot cross buns are a traditional Easter food. You can bake them
in advance and freeze unfrosted. When ready to serve, reheat
foil-wrapped buns in a 325ø oven. Drizzle cream cheese frosting in
the shape of a cross over the buns after reheating.

7 tablespoon lard
1  cayenne pepper to taste
2 cup bread flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup milk
1 large egg
3/4 cup sour cream

Hot Pretzels

breads

1 cup water (105-115 degrees f)
1 pkg active dry yeast
1 1/2 cup sifted all-purpose flour
2 tablespoon soft butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1 1/4 cup sifted all-purpose flour
4 cup water
5 teaspoon baking soda
1  coarse salt (i.e. kosher)

Combine water and yeast. Add 1 1/2 cup flour, butter, salt, and sugar
and beat at least 3 minutes. Add remaining 1 1/4 cup flour and knead
until dough is not sticky. Let rise in greased bowl until double.
Punch down and divide into twelve pieces. Roll pieces into 18 inch
long sticks with tapered ends. Loop into pretzel shape (helps to have
a commercial pretzel handy if you can't remember what they look
like). Place on greased baking sheet and let rise again until
doubled. Preheat oven to 475 degrees F.

Boil 4 cup water and 5 tsp baking soda (do not use aluminum pan) and
lower each pretzel into the water with slotted spoon. Let stay in
water about a minute or until they float. Return to greased cookie
sheet and sprinkle with coarse salt.

Bake until crispy and brown, about 12 minutes. Best eaten immediately
but can be cooled and stored about a week.

Hungarian Christmas Bread

breads, hungarian

1 pkg dry yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
2/3 cup warm water
1 cup butter, at room temperature
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon grated lemon peel
1/4 cup nonfat dry milk
2 1/2  to 3-1/2 cups unbleached flour
1 cup ground poppy seeds
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup milk
1  glaze:
1  egg beaten with 1 tsp wat

In a small cup, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the water. Let stand
for a few minutes.  Meanwhile, combine the butter, sugar, salt, 1
tbsp lemon peel, and milk in a large mixing bowl. Then add 2-1/2 cups
of flour alternately with the yeast mixture.  Blend the dough well.
Turn the dough out onto a floured board. Knead for about 10 minutes
until the dough is smooth and not sticky. Add more flour as
necessary. Put the dough into a greased bowl, turning so the top is
greased. Let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in bulk,
about 1 hour. While the dough is rising, prepare the filling. Combine
the poppy seeds, sugar,raisins, milk, and the rest of the lemon peel
in the top half of a double boiler. Cook it over hot water until the
mixture is of spreading consistency. Stir constantly. It should
thicken in about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to room
temperature.  Punch the dough down,divide in half, and roll each
piece into a long rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Spread the filling
on top of each piece, then roll up. Pinch the seams together so the
filling can't come out.  Place the rolls on a large greased baking
sheet and brush with the glaze.  Cover the rolls with wax paper laid
across water glasses so the paper doesn't touch the dough.  Let rise
again for 30 minutes. Apply a second coat of glaze. Bake the loaves
in a preheated 325 F oven for about an hour.  If the top browns too
rapidly, cover loosely with aluminum foil. Cool on a wire rack. Makes
2 loaves.

Icelandic Snowflake Breads (Laufabraud)

breads, ethnic

4 cup all purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon melted butter
2 cup milk, heated to boiling

hot fat for frying powdered sugar (optional)

In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder and sugar. Mix in the butter
and hot milk until a stiff dough is formed. Turn out onto a lightly
oiled surface and knead until smooth and cooled. Divide dough into
four parts. Shape each into a ball.  Divide each into 4 parts to make
16, then divide each of the resulting balls into 2 parts to total 32.

Cover baking sheets with waxed paper and dust the waxed paper lightly
with flour.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out each part of dough to make a
thin round about 8 inches in diameter. Place the rounds on the
floured waxed paper.  Chill 30 minutes.

In a skillet, heat 2 inches of fat to 375 to 400 degrees F. Vegetable
shortening or corn or peanut oil may be used but the authentic fat is
lard.

Fold gthe dough rounds, one at the time, into quarters, and, with a
sharp-tipped knife, make little cuts and cut-outs in the dough. Fry
the bread rounds, until golden brown, about 1 minute on each side.
Remove and drain on paper toweling.  Store in an airtight container
in a cool place or in the freezer until ready to serve.

bowl, cream together the brown sugar and butter. Mix the rolled
oats,rye flour, whole wheat flour, all purpose flour, salt, and
baking soda together in another bowl, then add the creamed mixture

Ileen's Brown Bread

breads, low fat

1 quart warm water
6 tablespoon instant potato flakes
6 cup stone-ground whole wheat
1  flour
4 cup stone-ground rye flour
2 cup steel-cut oatmeal
2 pkg active dry yeast
1/2 cup oil
1/2 cup molasses
1 tablespoon salt
3 large eggs, beaten
1  egg mixed with 1 tbsp water
1  for glaze
1  sesame seeds or wheat germ

Combine the flours & oatmeal.  Set aside. Whisk together potato
flakes in warm water.  Add yeast, stirring until dissolved. Add the
oil, molasses & salt.  Beat in 4 cups of the flour mixture until
smooth. Cover & let proof 20 -30 minutes or til light & bubbly. Stir
down the sponge & add the eggs. Gradually add sufficient flour
mixture to make a soft, workable dough that pulls away from the sides
of the bowl. Turn out onto a floured surface & knead 8 - 10 minutes
until smooth & resilient. Place the dough in a warm, buttered bowl,
turning to coat the top. Cover loosely with plastic wrap & a towel
and let rise until doubled, about 1 - 1 1/2 hours.

Punch down the dough & turn out onto a floured surface. Divide into 4
equal portions.  Knead each piece, cover & let rest 10 - 15 minutes.
Butter four 8 1/2" loaf pans. Form the dough into loaves & place in
the pans. Cover & let rise until just curved over tops of pans, about
30 -40 minutes. Brush the loaves with the glaze & sprinkle with seeds
or wheat germ.

Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  Let cool on wire racks.

Improved Cornbread

breads

2  eggs
2 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon honey
2 tablespoon vegetable oil (lard or crisco would; have been better)
1 cup buttermilk
1 cup white flour
1 cup cornmeal

Mix well while preheating greased pans or skillet at 400 for a few
minutes. Pour in batter and bake at 400 for 20-25 minutes. Could be
baked in cornbread pan or muffin tins also. I don't really use
buttermilk by the way. It would go bad in the fridge because I bake
so seldom. I use four tsp of dried buttermilk and one cup of water.
The real thing would be better I presume. Medium bread pans filled
half way will make two loafs.

Skillet method would be heat oil or lard while heating the pan, then
add to the batter before pouring into the skillet. Enjoy It!

I found that some recipes called for one egg, some all cornmeal flour
(which produces corn frisbees), some sugar instead of honey, and milk
instead of buttermilk. Confused? I was. This is my creation and I'm
not sure the salt is necessary. It will increase about 70% when
baked. Origin. Pete Porro 14 June, 1992

skillet with nonstick cooking spray and heat. Stir batter; pour 1/6
of batter (about scant 1/3 cup) into skillet and quickly swirl batter
so that it covers entire bottom of pan. Cover skillet with
tight-fitting lid and cook over high heat until bread is spongy and
moist (it will have air holes), about 1 minute (do not brown bottom
as edges will become crisp and bread will crack when folded);
transfer to plate and let cool. Repeat procedure 5 more times, making
5 more breads. To serve, fold each bread into quarters. Makes 6

Injera ("Sour Dough")

breads

1 3/4 cup unbleached white flour
1/2 cup self rising flour
1/4 cup whole wheat bread flour
1 pkg dry yeast,about 1 tablespoon
2 1/2 cup warm water
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt

Combine the flours and yeast in a ceramic or glass bowl. Add the warm
water and mix into a fairly thin, smooth batter. Let the mixture sit
for three full days at room temperature. Stir the mixture once a day.
It will bubble and rise.

When you are ready to make the injera, add the baking soda and salt
and let the batter sit for 10 to 15 minutes.

Heat a small, nonstick 9 inch skillet.  When a drop of water bounces
on the pan's surface, take about 1/3 cup of the batter and pour it in
the skillet quickly, all at once. Swirl the pan so that the entire
bottom is evenly coated, then return to the heat.

The injera is cooked on only one side and the bottom should not
brown. When the moisture has evaporated and lots of "eyes" appear on
the surface, remove the injera. Let each injera cool and then stack
them as you go along.

If the first injera is undercooked, try using less of the mixture,
perhaps 1/4 cup, and maybe cook it just a bit longer. Be sure not to
overcook it.
Injera should be soft and pliable so that it can be rolled or folded
like a crepe.

Injera (Flat Bread)

breads, ethnic, african

4 cup self-rising flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 cup club soda

Combine flours and baking powder in a bowl. Add club soda plus
about 4 cups water. Mix into a smooth, fairly thin batter. Heat a
large, non-stick skillet. When a drop of water  bounces on the pan's
surface, dip enough batter from the bowl to  cover the bottom of the
skillet, and pour it in quickly, all at once. Swirl the pan so that
the entire bottom is evenly coated,  then set it back on the heat.
When the moisture has evaporated and small holes appear on the
surface, remove the injera. It should be cooken only on one side, and
not too browned. If your first one is a little pasty and undercooked,
you may need to cook a little longer or to make  the next one
thinner. But, as with French crepes, be careful not to cook them too
long, or you'll have a crisp bread that may be  tasty but won't fold
around bits of stew. Stack the injera one on top of the other as you
cook, covering with a clean cloth to prevent their drying out.

Injera Bread

breads

3 cup warm water
2 1/2 cup self rising flour; goldmedal
3 tablespoon club soda

Place warm water into food blender. Add flour to water and blend,
slowly at first, then with rapid speed. <Do in two batches unless you
have a large and powerful blender> Remember to scrape down sides of
bowl with rubber spatula.

Place batter in 6 cup bowl and stir in the club soda.

Heat 12 inch electric frying pan <SiverStone lined> to 400. Using
ladle, pour 1/4c of batter onto one corner of the hot pan.
Immediately tilt the pan about to cover the bottom of the pan evenly
with the batter. Cook, uncovered, until the top of the pancakelike
bread is filled with holes and is no longer wet.  The edges should
begin to curl just a bit. Remove quickly with your fingers and place
the bread on a kitchen towel. Let it cool 3 or 4 mins as you prepare
the next bread. Place the cooled breads on a plate.

Continue this process until all of the batter is used. Stack the
cooled breads one on top of the other and cover with plastic wrap
until dinner.

Can be made 3 hours in advance of dinner.

Instant Potato Starter

breads

      ----STARTER----
1 pkg dry yeast,
1/2 cup sugar
2 cup warm water,
2 tablespoon salt
1/2 cup instant potato flakes
      ----FEED----
3/4 cup sugar,
1 cup warm water,
1 teaspoon instant potato flakes
      ----BREAD----
1 cup starter,
1 1/2 cup lukewarm water
1 teaspoon salt,
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup oil,
6 cup flour

STARTER:  Dissolve yeast in 1/2 C. of warm water. Add remaining
ingred. and stir well. Place in glass jar, covered loosely with foil,
plastic wrap, etc. (to allow for gas expansion). Keep at room
temperature for 24 hrs. Then place starter in frig. for 3-5 days.
Feed: After starter has been refrigerated 3-5 days, take out and feed
it above mixture. Let stand out (loosely covered) all day (8-10
hrs.). Take out 1 C. to use in making bread and return remaining
starter to frig. Keep refrigerated from 3-5 days; feed again. After
feeding, take out 1 C. to use in making bread, or give 1 C. to a
friend, or throw 1 C. away. Starter must be fed again in 3-5 days.
Bread: Mix first 5 ingred. together. Add in flour 1 C. at a time
until thoroughly mixed. Knead until good "elastic" consistency, but
don't over knead. Place approx. 2 Tbl. oil in bottom of large boowl;
turn dough over so oiled side is facing up. Cover with dish towl; let
rise until double - about 8-10 hrs. Punch down, knead again only a
few times, mixing in flour until good consistency. Divide dough in
half, shape into loaves. Place in ungreased loaf pans; let rise again
(4-6 hrs.). Bake @ 350 for 25-35 min. until golden brown and loaves
sound hollow when tapped. Cinnamon Bread: Before placing dough in
loaf pans to rise, roll out, brush with melted butter, sprinkle with
cinnamon and sugar. Roll up and place in loaf pan to rise. This is a
great receipe - I've enjoyed it for years! Your starter should bubble
a little after it has set out for the day (before you feed it). If
not, I have added yeast to the warm water of the "feed" and added it
in and the starter has recovered just fine! Enjoy! And let me know
how you like it! Don in Arlington, TX 8/28 9:40 a.m.

Irish Brown Bread #1 Monica Sheridan

breads

4 cup stone ground
1  whole wheat flour
2 cup white flour
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 cup buttermilk or sweet milk

Mix the whole wheat flour throughly with the white flour, salt, and
soda.

Make a well in the center and gradually mix in the liquid. Stir with a
wooden spoon. You may need lass, or more liquid - it depends on the
absorbent quality of the flour. The dough should be soft but
managable.

Knead the dough into a ball in the mixing bowl with your floured
hands. Put on a lightly floured baking sheet and with the palm of
your hand flatten out in a circle 1 1/2 inches thick. With a knife
dipped in flour, make a cross through the center of the bread so that
it will easily break into quarters when it is baked.

Bake at 425 degrees for 25 minutes, reduce the heat to 350 degrees
and bake a further 15 minutes.

If the crust seems too hard, wrap the baked bread in a damp tea cloth.
Leave the loaf standing upright until it is cool.

The bread should not be cut until it has set - about 6 hours after it
comes out of the oven.

1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 pkg dry yeast
1 cup potato water
1/2 cup margarine
2  eggs, room temperature

1 cup seedless raisins

In a large bowl thoroughly mix 1 1/2 cups flour, sugar, salt and

Heat over low heat until liquid is warm - the margarine does not need
to melt. Gradually add to dry ingredients and beat for 2 minutes at
medium speed with electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add
eggs, potatoes and 1/2 cup flour, or enough flour to make a thick
batter. Stir in raisins and enough additional flour to make a soft
dough. Turn out onto floured board. Knead until smooth and elastic,
about 10 minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning dough to grease.
Cover and let rise until doubled in bulk. Punch dough down.  Turn out
onto lightly floured board. Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Shape
each piece into a slender loaf, about 8 1/2 inches long. Put 2
loaves, side by side, in each of 2 greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 2 1/2 inch
loaf pans. Cover. Let rise in warm place, free from draft until

Irish Soda Bread #1

breads

3 1/2 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
1 1/4 cup buttermilk:  to 2 1/2 c *

* You will need somewhere between these two amounts of buttermilk,
depending on how much liquid your flour tends to absorb. Try to avoid
using regular milk: if you must, use baking powder instead of
bicarbonate of soda. -- Lightly grease a heavy skillet (if making
"soda farl", the flat version of soda bread) or preheat the oven to
450 F (if making "soda cake", the round, more breadlike version.)
Sift the dry ingredients together into a large bowl; make sure the
soda is evenly distributed. Make a well in the center of the dry
mixture and add about half the buttermilk. Stir until you have a
raggy dough that is very squashy but which looks more or less dry.
Add more liquid sparingly until you achieve this texture. Blend until
all the flour has achieved this consistency; then turn out
immediately onto a lightly floured board and knead ***for no more
than a minute or a minute and a half***. Overkneading makes this
bread very tough, and it's very easy to overdo it. If making soda
cake, shape the dough into a circle about 8-9 inches across and about
an inch and a half thick. Cut a cross about on the top, about half an
inch deep, and place on a floured baking sheet. Bake at 450 F for
45-50 minutes. If making soda farl, shape the dough into a circle
about 9 inches by one inch thick and cut into four wedges or "farls":
place in the preheated skillet, with cut edges about half an inch
apart. Cook slowly on the stovetop over low-to-medium heat: it should
take about 20 minutes for the farls to puff up and turn a light brown
on the pan side. Turn them and cook for another 20 minutes. -- For a
softer crust on either soda cake or soda farl, wrap in a dishtowel
after baking. -- For more information on making sodabread and its
variations, please see the file "SODABRED.TXT" included with this
zipfile.

Irish Soda Bread (With Variant For Spotted Do

breads, ethnic

6 cup all purpose flour
2 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoon baking powder
3 tablespoon cornstarch
2 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 cup buttermilk ***
      ----ADD FOR "SPOTTED DOG----
1/2 cup raisins or sultanas

***  may substitute 2 1/2 cup water and 10 tablespoons buttermilk
powder.

Preheat Oven to 375 degrees.

Add all of the dry ingredients in a large bowl and mix very well. (If
making Spotted Dog variant, then add raisins.) Pour all of the
buttermilk into the bowl at once and stir, using a wooden spoon, just
until a soft dough is formed.  Do not try to make it smooth at this
point. Pour the contents of the bowl out onto a plastic counter and
knead for a minute or so until everything comes together. You may
need to add a bit more flour depending on humidity.  The dough should
be smooth, not sticky.

Divide the dough into two portions and shape each into a round loaf,
pressing the top down a bit to just barely flatten it. Place the
loaves on a large ungreased baking sheet. Sprinkle some additional
flour on the top of each loaf and, using a sharp paring knife, make
the sign of the Cross in slashes on the top of each.

Allow the loaves to rest for 10 minutes and then bake on the middle
rack of the oven for 40 minutes, or until the loaves are golden brown
and done to taste.

Cool on racks.

Adapted from: The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors, by Jeff
Smith. Entered by Dale & Gail Shipp, Columbia Md. Personal comment: a
close Irish friend gives her stamp of approval on this as being an
authentic Irish soda bread.  She supplied the "Spotted Dog" variant.

Irish Soda Bread 2

breads

1 tablespoon butter, softened
4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup buttermilk

Preheat the oven to 425.  With a pastry brush coat a baking sheet
evenly with the tablespoon of softened butter. Sift the flour, soda
and salt together into a deep mixing bowl. Gradually add 1 cup of the
buttermilk, beating constantly with a large spoon until the dough is
firm enough to be gathered into a ball . If the dough crumbles, beat
up to 1/2 cup more buttermilk into it by the tablespoon until the
particles adhere.

Place the dough on a lightly floured board and pat and shape it into
a flat circular loaf about 8" in diameter and 1 1/2 " thick. Set he
loaf on the baking sheet. Then with the tip of a small knife cut a
1/2" deep X into the dough,dividing the top of the loaf into quarters.

Bake the brad int the middle of the oven for about 45 minutes or
until the top is golden brown.

There are a couple of variations on this.  You can add 1 cup currants
or raisins with the flour.  Also you can sprinkle the top of the loaf
with caraway seeds.

Irish Soda Bread With Herbs

breads, quick bread

1  from:  the trellis cookbook
4 cup plus 1 tbsp bread flour
1 tablespoon fresh dill; chopped
1 tablespoon fresh tarragon; chopped
1 tablespoon fresh thyme; chopped
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 cup buttermilk
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1  egg yolk
1 tablespoon ; water
1  variations:
1  scallion soda bread:
1/4 cup scallions; thinly sliced, instead of
1  raisin soda bread:
1/3 cup raisins; instead of herbs
1  caraway seed soda bread
2 tablespoon caraway seeds; instead of herbs

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.  In the bowl of an electric mixer
fitted with a paddle, combine 4 cups flour, the chopped herbs, baking
powder, salt, and baking soda (breaking up any lumps). Mix on low
speed for 2 minutes.  Place the buttermilk and vegetable oil in a
stainless steel bowl and whisk gently to combine. Gradually add the
buttermilk mixture to the combined dry ingredients while mixing on
low speed and continue to mix until the dough forms a ball, 30 to 40
seconds. Scrape the dough away from the paddle and turn the dough
ball over. Mix on low speed for an additional 30 seconds.

Flour a clean, dry surface with the remaining tbsp flour. Transfer the
dough ball to the floured surface and knead with the heels of your
hands until smooth. Form the dough into a round loaf. Pinch a small
handful of dough and gently twist, being careful not to tear the
dough from the loaf. Place the loaf, pinched side down, on a baking
sheet lined with parchment paper.

Whisk the egg yolk with 1 tbsp water, then lightly brush the mixture
over the top of the loaf.  Score the loaf by cutting a 1/4" deep "X"
into the top.  Bake the loaf in the preheated oven for 50 to 55
minutes. The bread is done if a hollow sound is heard when the bottom
is tapped with your finger.  Allow the bread to cool to room temp
before slicing.

Notes - the dough must be kneaded vigorously by hand; this should take
about 2 minutes.  Pinching and twisting the loaf to form a base will
give the finished bread a tighter and taller shape. This procedure is
not necessary; however, the finished loaf will be much flatter if the
base is not pinched and twisted as suggested. Rather than using dried
herbs, if fresh herbs are not available, use an equivalent amount of
chopped spinach. Author - Marcel Desaulniers

Irish Whiskey Soda Bread

breads, irish

      ----BREAD----
4 cup flour, all purpose
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 cup butter, chilled
1 cup raisins or currants (option)
1/2 cup honey, liquid
1/4 cup irish whisky or buttermilk
      ----GLAZE----
2 teaspoon irish whisky
2  ilk

BREAD:  In large bowl, combine flour, salt and baking soda.  With
pastry blender or two knives, cut in butter until mixture resembles
coarse crumbs. Stir in raisins or currants (if using).  In separate
bowl, combine buttermilk, honey and whisky.  Add all at once to dry
ingredients; stir just until no dry spots remain.  Turn dough out
onto lightly floured surface.  Knead lightly 1 minute (too much
handling will toughen loaves, while too little will inhibit rising.)
Divide dough in half and shape each half into an 8 in (20 cm) round.
Place in two greased 8 in (1.2 L) round cake pans.  With floured
knife, cut a cross 1/2 in deep in each loaf.
GLAZE:  In small bowl, combine whisky and milk.  Brush loaves with
glaze.
Bake in 350F (180C) oven 35 to 40 minutes or until loaves sound
hollow when tapped on bottoms.  Remove from pans; let cool on wire
racks.  Cut into wedges.

breads, quick bread

3 cup flour, whole wheat
1 cup flour, all purpose
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 cup buttermilk, yogurt, or milk soured; with lemon juice

Combine the dry ingredients and mix thouroughly to distribute the

dough but firm enough to hold its shape. Knead on a lightly floured
board for 2 or 3 minutes, until quite smooth and velvety. Form into a
round loaf and place in a well buttered 8 inch cake pan or on a well
buttered cookie sheet. Cut a cross on the top of the loaf with a very
sharp floured knife. Bake in a preheated 375F oven for 35-40 minutes,

with the knuckles. (The cross will have spread open which is
characteristic of soda bread.) From _Beard on Bread_.

Italian Country Bread With Biga

breads, ethnic

1  biga:
1 teaspoon yeast
1 1/8 cup warm water
2 cup bread flour
1  dough:
1  biga (above )
1 1/4 cup bread flour
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup water

Biga is a starter, almost similar to sourdough but not quite.The
bread has a flavorful, yeasty beery quality. So 10 to 12 hours before
you want the bread, mix the 1 tsp. yeast in the water and let it
bubble and foam. Mix in the flour gradually to make a soft almost
soupy dough. Cover and it will rise and triple in volume and then
fall back and re-rise during the 6 to 8 hours you let it be. Then
make the bread. Stir the salt right into the biga mixture, mix in the
additional water ( cold or cool not warm ) until it is a thin soupy
quality. Mix in the flour to make a firm but soft dough which leaves
the sides of the bowl. Turn out to a floured surface and knead dough,
adding additional flour if necessary to make a smooth dry dough.
Place dough in a bowl, greased with olive oil, cover and let rise
doubled about 2 hours. Punch dough down and knead it into a flat
oval. cut in half and form each half into a baguette and let them
rest covered with a towel for 30 minutes. then stretch them into
longer baguette shapes and place them in a baguette baking tray if
you have it. Let rest for 20 minutes. then slash tops and place into
a preheated 450 oven for 20 minutes or done. If you don't have a
baguette tray any baking sheet or baking stone will do. You also
could shape the breads in one large round loaf instead of 2
baguettes. Bake the one large loaf 10 to 15 minutes longer. Note:
since this bread is fat free eat the same day or freeze as it stales
quickly.

Italian Easter Bread

breads, italian

1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 pkg dry yeast
2 1/2  to 3-1/2 cups unbleached flour
2/3 cup milk
2 tablespoon butter
2  eggs, at room temperature
1/2 cup mixed candied fruit
1/3 cup chopped blanched almonds.
1/2 teaspoon anise seed
2 tablespoon melted shortening
5  uncooked eggs colored with easter e; gg dye
1  icing:
1 cup confectioner's sugar
1 tablespoon milk
1/8 teaspoon vanilla

colored sprinkles

In a large mixing bowl, blend the sugar, salt, and yeast well with 1
cup of the flour.  In a saucepan, combine milk and butter, heating
slowly until liquid is warm and butter is melted. Pour the milk into
the dry ingredients and beat 125 strokes with a wooden spoon. Add
eggs and 1/2 cup flour or enough to make a thick batter. beat
vigorously for 2 minutes.

Then stir in enough flour to make a ball of dough that draws away
from the sides of the bowl.  Turn out onto a floured board and knead
for about 10 minutes, working in additional flour to overcome
stickiness. Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning to grease the
top. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and put in a warm, draft-free
place until doubled in bulk about 1 hour. Meanwhile, combine the
fruit,nuts, and anise seed. Punch down the dough and return it to a
lightly floured board. Knead in the fruit mixture, keeping the syrupy
pieces dusted with flour until they are worked into the dough.
Divide the dough in half. Carefully roll each piece into a 24 inch
rope - the fruit and nuts will make this slightly difficult. Loosely
twist the two ropes together and form a ring on a greased baking
sheet.  Pinch the ends together well. Brush the dough with melted
shortening.  Push aside the twist to make a place for each egg.

Push eggs down carefully as far as possible.  Cover the bread with wax
paper and let rise in a warm,draft-free place until double in bulk,
about 1 hour.  Bake the bread in a preheated 350 F oven for about 35
minutes or until a toothpick inserted in a twist comes out clean.
Place on a wire rack to cool. Once the bread is cool, drizzle the
icing on top between the eggs, and decorate with colored sprinkles.
Makes 1 loaf.

Jalapeno Breadsticks

appetizers, breads

1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/2 medium onion; chopped medium fine
1  cornmeal
2 teaspoon active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water
1 1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
6  jalapeno chiles  (fresh or canned); seeded, and chopped
1 cup buttermilk
3 1/2 cup bread flour

Saute onion in butter over medium heat until lightly browned. Remove
from heat and set aside. Lightly grease three large baking sheets and
sprinkle them with cornmeal. Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a
mixing bowl. Let stand until yeast is dissolved, then stir in sugar,
salt, chopped jalapenos, sauteed onion, buttermilk and 2 cups of the
flour. Beat mixture well.  Stir in enough of the remaining flour to
make dough easy to handle. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured
surface; knead about 5 minutes. Place in a large greased bowl, cover,
and let rise in a warm place until double, about 1-1/2 to 2 hours.
Punch down dough and divide into 4 equal parts. On a floured surface,
roll out one part dough to form an 8" x 8" square. Using a knife or
pizza cutter, cut the square into 8 equal strips. Place the strips
onto prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining portions of dough.
Let rise uncovered (1 hour or more for light, airy breadsticks; 30
minutes for a denser, chewier texture). Bake in a preheated 400øF
oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown.

2 1/4 oz envelope active dry yeast or 2 3/5-; ounce cakes fresh
1 tablespoon sugar
2 1/4 cup lukewarm water
1/4 cup oil or unsalted butter,
1  melted
1 cup whole wheat flour
5 cup unbleached all-purpose
1  flour
1 tablespoon salt
4  to 6 jalapeno chiles or to taste,se; eded & finely chopped*
2 cup shredded sharp cheddar
1  cheese (1/2 pound)
1  egg glaze
1  egg
1 tablespoon water
1  cornmeal for sprinkling

Serving Size  : TWO 9- BY 5-INCH LOAVES OR 24 BREAD STICKS 1.
Sprinkle the dry yeast or crumble the fresh yeast and Sugar Over 1/2
cup of the lukewarm water in a cup or smaII bowl. Leave it for 10
minutes, then stir to dissolve the yeast. Add the remaining water and
oil. 2. Sift the flours together into a large mixing bowl. Set aside
2 cups of the mixture. Add the salt to the remaining mixture and make
a well in center. Pour the yeast mixture into the well, add the
chopped chiles, and mix briefly. 3. Gradually stir in the reserved
flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough loses its stickiness and
can be kneaded easily. Knead the dough thoroughly on a floured
surface until it is smooth and elastic, flouring the surface
Occasionally if the dough sticks to it. Transfer the dough to an
oiled bowl and turn it over to oil its entire surface. Cover with a
damp cloth and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1/2 hours or
until doubled in volume. Punch down the dough and let it rest, about
5 minutes, covered with a cloth. (This allows the dough to regain its
elasticity.) 4. Knead the dough again on a lightly floured surface.
Knead in the cheese by sprinkling it on the bread all at once and
kneading until distributed. 5. Grease two 9- by 5-inch loaf pans.
Divide the dough into 2 equal parts and on the floured surface roll
out each part to a smooth, cylindrical loaf about 9 inches long. Put
the loaves in the pans seam side down, slash the top lightly 3 times
with a serrated knife, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a
warm place for about 1 hour or until nearly doubled in volume. 6. For
the egg glaze, whisk the egg and water together until slightly foamy.
Brush the loaves with the egg glaze. Sprinkle lightly with cornmeal.
Preheat the oven to 375F. 7. Bake the loaves for about 15 minutes or
until they begin to brown. Reduce the temperature to 350F and
continue baking for another 45 minutes or until the bread sounds
hollow when tapped. Let the loaves cool on a rack. Serve lukewarm or
at room temperature.

James Beard's Cheese Bread

breads

1 pkg active dry yeast
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 3/4 cup warm (100-115 deg) water
5  to 6 cups all purpose flour
1 tablespoon salt, or to taste
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 teaspoon tabasco
1/4 cup parmesan cheese, freshly grated
3/4 cup gruyere or emmenthaler cheese, shre; dded

Dissolve the yeast with the sugar in 1/4 cup of the warm water and
allow to proof. In a large bowl, mix 5 cups of flour and the salt.
Make a well in the center and add the remaining 1 1/2 cups warm
water, the butter, the Tabasco, and the yeast mixture. Stir with a
wooden spoon or spatula or with your floured hands until the dough is
well amalgamated. Turn out on a heavily floured board (use 1/2 cup
flour) and knead for 10 to 12 minutes or until the dough is smooth,
elastic, and rather satiny in texture and all the flour on the board
is absorbed; add flour if you need it. Place the dough in a buttered
or oiled bowl and turn to coat on all sides. Cover with a towel and
let rise in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in bulk, 1-1/2 to 2
hours or slightly more.
Punch down the dough, turn it out on a lightly floured board, and
knead in the cheeses. When thouroughly blended, cut the dough in half
and let rest for 10 minutes, then roll out each half into a rectangle
about 11 X 6 inches and let rest for 2 or 3 minutes more. Roll each
triangle up, pinching the edges as you do so, and tucking in the ends
so that the loaf measures about 4-1/2 X 7-1/2 inches. Place the dough
in two well buttered tins, cover, and let rise in a warm spot until
the bread has reached the top of the tin, or slightly higher, or has
more or less doubled in size.
Bake on the center of the middle rack of a preheated 375F deg oven
for approximately 30 minutes, or until the loaves sound hollow when
removed from the tins and rapped with the knuckles on both top and
bottom. Bake directly on the oven rack, without the tins, for a few
minutes to firm the crust. Cool the bread on racks before slicing.
VARIATIONS:
* Instead of the butter, use 1/3 cup peanut oil or olive oil. Also
use oil on the baking tins.
* Use fresh Parmesan orRomano only - a little over a cup - or use a
mixture of the two.
* Use sharp shredded Chedder instead of the Gruyere cheese.
* Bake as one loaf in a 10 X 4-1/2 X 3-inch pan, which will make a
thicker , more concentrated loaf and will take slightly longer to
bake. SOURCE: Beard on Bread by James A. Beard Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.

adding flour as necessary. Place in a buttered bowl and turn to coat
the surface with butter.

Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk..1 1/2-2 hrs.

Punch down the dough. Turn out on a floured board and shape into two
long, French bread-style loaves. Place on a baking sheet that has

James Beard's Persimmon Bread

breads, fruits, liquor

3 1/2 cup sifted all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground mace
2 cup to 2 1/2 cups granulated sugar
1 cup butter, melted
4 large eggs, lightly beaten
2/3 cup cognac or bourbon
1  *remy martin suzy's choice
2 cup persimmon puree (the pulp
1  of about 4md. persimmons -  not nec; essary to peel
2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts optional
2 cup raisins -optional

Source: Beard on Bread 1973

Sift all five dry ingredients into a mixing bowl. Then make a well in
the center and add the melted butter, egg, Cognac, persimmon puree,
and if you like, the nuts and raisins. Mix the dough until it is
quite smooth. smooth. Butter and flour four molds*, fill them about
three-fourths full,, and bake for 1 hr. at 350° F. Cool the loaves in
the molds and turn out on a rack.

NOTE: Wrap in foil after cooling if you wish to keep them. They will
keep nicely from 1 to 2 weeks.

Persimmons grow in many countries of the world, but often, as in
France, they are left hanging on the trees. In this country (USA) we
have learned to appreciate their superb deep-orange color, their
shape, and their delicate flavor, and they are becoming increasingly
popular. In earlier times they were allowed to ripen on the trees
until dead ripe before being eaten raw or used for puddings, cookies,
and breads. Nowadays they show up in our markets in a firm state and
must be left at room temperature for several days or a week to ripen
until they are almost mushy.

This old recipe, sent to me by a dear friend from the Middle West,
makes a bread that is almost cakelike in texture. Spread with good
fresh butter, it is very pleasant to eat along with a cup of tea or
to use for a cream-cheese Sandwich. It is unusual, rich, and
thoroughly delicious.

*Traditionally this bread is baked in four 1-pound buttered and
floured coffee cans, but you can use 3- to 4-cup charlotte molds (my
preference, (JB) round Pyrex dishes, or round stainless steel bowls.

*I use Remy Martin and coffee cans as molds for gift giving holiday
time. This is a fabulous recipe!

James Beard's Salt Rising Bread (Ee)

breads

1  salt-rising bread starter:
1 1/2 cup hot water
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup warm water  (100 to 115 degrees)
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup lukewarm whole milk  (90 to 110 deg; rees)
2 tablespoon butter, melted
1 teaspoon salt
5 1/2 cup flour

Recipe by: ESSENCE OF EMERIL SHOW #EE2134  Make starter: In a glass
bowl mix together all ingredients for starter. Cover with a plate and
place in a barely warm oven for 12 hours, or until top is covered
with 1/2 to 1-inch of foam (a gas oven with pilot light is warm

milk, butter and salt into potato liquid. Add 2 cups of flour and
beat until very smooth. Add 2 1/2 cups more flour, stirring until
dough comes together. Sprinkle remaining flour over work surface,
turn out dough and knead for 10 to 12 minutes, until dough is smooth.
Divide in two and form into loaves. Place loaves in 2 well-buttered
loaf pans, cover and set aside in a warm place to double, 4 to 5
hours. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bake 35 to 45 minutes or until
bottom of loaves sound hollow when tapped. Turn loaves out of pans

James Beard's Sourdough Rye

breads

2 pkg active dry yeast
3 1/4 cup warm water (100-115 deg)
6 cup all-purpose flour (approx)
2 cup rye flour
2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon caraway seeds
1 1/2 teaspoon poppy seeds
2 tablespoon melted butter
3 tablespoon granulated sugar
1  cornmeal
1  egg, lightly beaten in
1 tablespoon water

Four days ahead of breadmaking, prepare the "starter". Combine 1
package of the yeast, 2 cups warm water, and 2 cups all-purpose flour
in a plastic bowl or container. Cover tightly and let stand for 2
days at room temperature. Then refrigerate for at least another day
(see note below).

The day before preparing the dough, combine 1 cup of starter, the rye
flour, and 1 cup warm water in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let
stand overnight at room temperature. The next day stir down the dough
and add the second package of yeast, dissolved in 1/4 cup warm water,
salt, caraway seeds, poppy seeds, butter, and sugar. Then add up to 4
cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup at a time, to make a stiff but workable
dough. Knead for 10 to 12 minutes, then shape into a ball. Place in a
buttered bowl, turning to coat the dough with the butter. Cover and
let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in bulk, about two
hours.

Punch down and divide the dough in half. Shape into two round loaves
and place on buttered baking sheets generously sprinkled with
cornmeal.

Cover and let rise again until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Brush
with the egg wash, and bake in a preheated 375 deg F. oven for 30
minutes, or until lightly browned and the loaves sound hollow when
rapped with the knuckles. Cool, covered with towels to prevent the
crust from hardening.

NOTE: This will provide more starter than you need for this recipe.
To keep it going, replenish with equal parts of warm water and flour,
let stand again at room temperature, then refrigerate.  Continue the
process each time you use some of it.

Jane Brody's High-Calcium Cabbage Bread

breads

1/2 cup finely shredded red cabbage
1/2 cup finely shredded green cabbag
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 cup plain non/low-fat yogurt
1/4 cup orange juice concentrate *
1/4 cup canola oil
1/4 cup powdered nonfat milk
1  egg
1 cup whole-wheat flour
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup toasted sesame seeds
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)
1/8 teaspoon mace
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger

* 1/4 cup orange juice and 1 tablespoon sugar can replace concentrate.

The author says this can be made with 1 cup of only one type of
cabbage but for the sake of color would choose red cabbage.

1. Preheat oven to 350 F.

2. Place the cabbage in a small bowl and toss it with lemon juice.

3. In large measuring cup or medium bowl, combine the yogurt, orange
juice concentrate, oil, powdered milk and egg, blending the
ingredients well.  Stir in the cabbage.

4. In large bowl, combine the flours, sesame seeds, baking powder,
baking
soda, salt, mace and ginger, mixing them well.

5. Gradually add the cabbage mixture to the flour mixture and mix the
ingredients until they are just combined.  Pour the batter into a
greased 8x4 inch loaf pan.

6. Place the pan in hot oven and bake for 35-45 minutes or until a
tester
inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean. Turn the
bread
out onto a rack to cool completely before slicing.

This is a great bread to serve with a soup or salad meal. After the
first day, it is wonderful toasted. Try it, too, as a sandwich bread.

Jane Burbank's Hushpuppies (Florida Cooking)

breads

1 cup self-rising corn meal- (preferably; white stone- ground)
1/2 cup self-rising flour
1/4 cup pancake mix (see note)
1  pinch salt
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 each egg
1 medium onion, diced
1/2 cup milk, or as needed
1  oil or fish drippings for- frying

Hushpuppies are fried in hot drippings left after frying fish,
picking up some of the fresh fish flavor.

Combine the corn meal, flour, pancake mix, salt, sugar, and pepper in
a bowl.  Beat the egg lightly in a measuring cup, and add the onion
and enough milk to fill to the 1-cup mark. Mix the liquids into the
dry mixture well.  If not moist throughout, add a tablespoonfull or
two more of milk, blending well.

Put any fish drippings you may have in a heavy frying pan and add
enough oil to a depth of 1/4 inch.  Heat and drop a small amount of
batter into the fat.  If it sizzles, the fat is hot enough. Make a
test hushpuppy: Drop a teaspoonful of batter in; if it spreads like a
pancake, the batter is too thin, so stir a tablespoonful or two of
corn meal into the uncooked batter. If, after the test hushpuppy has
cooked, it is dense and dry, stir 2 or 3 teasponns of milk into the
batter. When the batter consistency is right, drop the batter from
the tip of a teaspoon into the pan; cook 6, 8, or 10 at a time, being
careful not to let the hushpuppies overlap while frying. Cook until
lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes, turn, and brown the other side,
about 3 minutes.  Drain on paper towels and keep hot while frying the
remaining hushpuppies. Add more oil to the pan as needed, a little at
a time, to prevent cooking.  Fat should be kept medium-hot, to brown
hushpuppies.  Check often so that hushpuppies do not scorch.

NOTE:  In Florida many like to use self-rising flour and corn meal as
well as pancake mix in hushpuppies and other breads. If you wish,
substitute all-purpose flour for self-rising and the pancake mix; use
plain corn meal in place of the self-rising type.  Then to the dry
ingredients add 1 tablespoon baking powder and 1 teaspoon salt. Add
the liquid ingredients, then proceed with the recipe as directed.

Jewish "Corn" Bread

breads, sourdough, jewish

1 1/2 cup water,warm (110 degree)
1 pkg yeast, dry
1/2 teaspoon sugar
4 teaspoon salt
3 cup rye sourdough starter
1  measured after stirring down
1  at room temperature.
2 cup flour, gluten
3 1/2 cup flour, all-purpose or as
1  needed.
1  cornmeal (for sprinkling
1  the baking sheets)
1  glaze:
1  egg white beaten with 2 tbs
1  water.
1  optional topping:
2 teaspoon chernushka (black caraway)
1  seeds.

You can buy chernushka "black caraway" in some health food stores or
from mail-order. They are nothing like the familiar caraway seeds.
This bread is a New York specialty, usually made in bakeries.

1.  Combine 1/2 cup of the warm water, the yeast and sugar and let
stand until doubled in bulk, about 10 minutes.
2. Dissolve the salt
in the remaining warm water in a mixing bowl. Mix in the sourdough
starter, then the yeast mixture, then the gluten flour and 2 cups of
the all-purpose flour; make a soft dough.
3. Spread 1 1/2 cups flour
on the kneading surface and turn the dough out onto it. Knead, adding
more flour if necessary to make a soft dough that will hold its
shape. Do not overknead.. the dough should be only slightly elastic,
even a bit sticky.
4. Form the dough into a ball and put in an
ungreased bowl; cover with plastic, and let rise until doubled in
bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.
5. Turn the dough out onto a lightly flour
surface and knead it a few strokes to expel air. Cover with a towel
and let rest for 15 minutes.
6. Divide the dough in half. Form each
half into a loaf by flattening in to an inch-thick oval about 12
inches long, then rolling it up from one long side. Pinch the seam
closed. Shape the ends of the oval loaves neatly and plce them on two
cornmeal-dusted baking sheets, seam down. Cover with towels and let
rise until "three-quarters proofed," or not fully doubled.
7.  While the loaves are rising, set a large roasting pan containing 2
inches of boiling water on the oven floor (or the lowest shelf of an
electric oven) and preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
8. Brush the
loaves with egg-white glaze, being careful not to let the glaze drip
onto the pan, as it sticks and burns.  With a single-edged razor
blade or a small, sharp knife, cut three diagonal slashes, holding
the blade almost parallel to the surface, about 1/4 inch deep on each
loaf. Sprinkle the loaves with "black caraway" or caraway seeds, if
you like.
9. Bake for 30 minutes on the middle and upper shelves of
the oven, then brush again with glaze, exchange shelf positions, and
remove the water pan. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes longer, or until
there is a hollow sound when you rap the bottom of the loaf.
10. Cool the bread on racks.

Jewish Rye Bread

breads

1  poolish :
3 cup spring water, 75 degrees
1 1/2 teaspoon dry yeast
2 tablespoon sugar, raw or granulated
3 cup flour, unbleached bread
1  final dough :
2 cup rye flour, medium ground
1/4 cup caraway seeds
1 tablespoon oil, vegetable
1 tablespoon salt, sea
1 tablespoon sugar, raw or granulated
3 cup flour, unbleached bread

MAKE & FERMENT THE POOLISH (allow 5 hours):
:       Combine the water, yeast, and sugar in a 6-quart bowl. Let
stand 1 minute, then stir with a wooden spoon until yeast and sugar
are dissolved. Add the unbleached flour and stir until the
consistency of a thick batter. Continue stirring for about 100
strokes or until the strands of gluten come off the spoon when you
press the back of the spoon against the bowl. Scrape down the sides
of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Cover with a clean damp kitchen
towel or plastic wrap, and put in a moderately warm (74-80 degree)
draft-free place until it is bubbly and increased in volume. (The
poolish can be refrigerated overnight. Allow to stand at room
temperature for 2 hours before proceeding.)

MIX & KNEAD THE FINAL DOUGH (20 minutes):
:       Measure the ingredients and make sure all ingredients,
including the poolish are at 74-80 degrees. Transfer the poolish to
your mixing bowl. Add the rye flour, caraway seeds, oil, salt, and
sugar. Stir with a wooden spoon until well combined. Add enough of
the unbleached flour to make a thick mass that is difficult to stir.
Turn out onto a well-floured surface. Knead, adding more of the
remaining flour when needed until dough is soft and smooth, 15-20
minutes. The dough is ready when a small amount pulled from the mass
springs back quickly.

FERMENT THE DOUGH (2 hours):
:       Shape the dough into a ball and let it rest on a lightly
floured surface while you lightly butter or grease a large bowl.
Place the dough in the bowl and turn the dough to coat the top. Take
the dough's temperature; the ideal is 78 degrees. Cover with a clean
damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm
(74-80 degrees) draft-free place until doubled in volume.
:       NOTE: If the dough temperature is higher than 78 degrees, put
in a cooler than 78 degree place like the refrigerator, until the
dough cools to 78 degrees. If it is lower than 78 degrees, put it in
a warmer than 78 degree place until the dough warms up to 78 degrees.
The point is to try to keep the dough at 78 degrees during its
fermentation. If you do have to move the dough, be gentle and don't
jostle it, or the dough may deflate.

FERMENT THE DOUGH A SECOND TIME (45 minutes):
:       Deflate the dough by pulling up on the sides and pushing down
in the center. Re-form into a ball, return to the ball, and cover
again with a damp towel or plastic wrap. Put in a moderately warm
(74-80 degree) draft-free place until doubled in volume.

FERMENT THE DOUGH A THIRD TIME (45 minutes):
:       Deflate again the same as before, shape into a ball, return to
bowl, and cover again. Put in a moderately warm (74-80 degree) place
until doubled again.

DIVIDE & SHAPE THE DOUGH INTO LOAVES (10 minutes):
:       Deflate the dough by pushing down in the center and pulling
up on the sides. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface
and knead briefly. Cut the dough into 2 equal pieces. Flatten each
with the heel of your hand using firm direct strokes. Shape each
piece into a tight ball for round loaves.

PROOF THE LOAVES (1 hour):
:       Place the loaves on a lightly floured board. Cover with a damp
towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm (74-80 degree)
place until doubled in volume.

BAKE THE LOAVES (45 minutes):
:       45 minutes to 1 hour before baking, preheat the oven and
baking stone, if you have one, on the center rack of the oven to 450
degrees.
:       The oven rack must be in the center of the oven. If it is in
the lower third of the oven, the bottoms of the breads may burn, and
if it is in the upper third, the top crusts may burn.
:       Using a very sharp, serrated knife or a single-edged razor
blade, score the loaves by making quick shallow cuts 1/4 to 1/2 inch
deep along the surface. Slide the loaves one at a time onto the
baking stone, if you are using one, and quickly spray the inner walls
and floor of the oven with cold water from a spritzer bottle. If
there's an electric light bulb in the oven, avoid spraying it
directly...it may burst. Spray for several seconds until steam has
filled the oven. Quickly close the door to trap the steam and bake 3
minutes. Spray again in the same way, closing the door immediately so
that steam doesn't escape. Bake 12 minutes. Reduce heat to 400
degrees and bake until loaves are a rich caramel color and the crust
is firm, another 15-20 minutes.
:       To test the loaves for doneness, remove and hold the loaves
upside down. Strike the bottoms firmly with your finger. If the sound
is hollow, the breads are done. If it doesn't sound hollow, bake 5
minutes longer.
:       Cool completely on wire racks.

Jim's Buttermilk Bread

breads

1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water
1/4  to 1/3 cup honey
2 cup buttermilk - room temperature
6  to 6 1/2 cups unbleached flour
2 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoon olive oil

Makes two 8-inch loaves

Make a sponge by dissolving the yeast in the warm water in a large
bowl. Mix in the honey.  Add 1 cup of buttermilk. Stir in 3 cups of
the flour, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and leave it in a warm
place for 15-20 minutes until it swells and bubbles on the top.

Meanwhile dissolve the salt and add the olive oil, in the remaining
buttermilk.  When the sponge is ready add this to it along with all
but 1/2 cup of the remaining flour. Mix well until it becomes hard to
stir, then turn out on a floured working surface and knead, adding
more flour as necessary until the dough is smooth and resilient -
about 8-10 minutes.

Clean out the bowl, oil or butter it, and return the dough, turning
to coat with grease.  Cover with plastic and leave to rise until
double in bulk, about
15    minutes or so.

Turn the dough out, punch down, then form into two loaves. Place in
greased bread pans, cover lightly with plastic, and let rise again,
about 15 minutes. Bake in a preheated 425 F oven 10 minutes, then
lower the heat to 350 F and continue to bake 30 minutes. Cool on
racks.

Jim's Yorkshire Pudding

breads, beef, puddings, english

1 3/4 cup flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk; at room temp.
4  eggs; at room temp.
1 cup water; at room temp.
1  beef drippings or melted suet for t; he pan.

Many Yorkshire pudding recipes in American cook books call for butter
and all milk/no water; that's a Pop-over or something not a real
Yorkshire Pud. This pudding needs no butter or fat in the batter as
there is plenty of beef fat in the pan for flavor. The ingredients
are so simple that the final product is a real surprise to first time
cooks 'cause it's SO GOOD! It used to be the custom in England to
cook the pudding in a tray under the roast and catch all the
drippings. You get a tastier result from making small puddings in
muffin trays in a hot oven after the roast is out as they puff up
more and brown nicely.

In olden days it was served before the roast which would be served
with gravy covered potatoes AND bread to stretch out the meat.
Today's diet conscious hosts would usually serve the puddings with
the roast instead of potatoes and bread.

N.B. The ingredients must be at room temp when mixed to maximize the
puffing effect.

Preheat the oven to 400 F

In a bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Make a well in the
centre and pour in the milk. Stir. In another bowl beat the eggs
until fluffy and then add the water. Beat this mixture into the
batter until large bubbles form. [Let stand up to an hour if you need
to finish the roast.]

Heat the muffin tins in the oven. Pour beef drippings or melted suet
into each muffin hole to a depth of 1/4". It should be hot enough to
sizzle but not smoke. Pour in the batter about 5/8" to 3/4" deep.
Bake at 400 F for about 20 minutes; reduce heat to 350 F and bake
another 10 to 15 minutes. Serve at once with the roast, gravy, and
hot mustard or horseradish.

Johnnycake With Chervil

breads, herbs

1 tablespoon corn oil
1 cup all-purpose flour; sifted
2 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 pinch salt
1 cup yellow cornmeal
2  eggs; lightly beaten
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 cup buttermilk or soured milk
1/2 cup fresh chervil, no stems* - loosely; packed

*If chervil is unavailable, Italian parsley can be used instead.

Brush a square 8" baking pan with the oil.  Once oven is preheated,
heat greased pan until hot (but watch carefully). This helps ensure a
crispy bottom and sides. Muffin or cornstick pans may also be used.

Sift flour with sugar, baking powder and salt.  Stir in cornmeal. In
separate bowl, mix eggs with oil and buttermilk. Chop chervil leaves
to yield about 1/4 cup. Stir into milk-egg mixture. Make a well in
the dry ingredients and quickly pour in liquid.  Blend quickly with a
spatula just until mixed.  Do not overmix.

Pour batter into prepared pan.  Bake at 425 F. 20 minutes, or until
golden brown and crisp around edges. (Muffins or cornsticks may only
take 15 minutes). Cut into squares and serve at once, spreading with
butter if desired.

Save any leftovers and freeze for cornbread poultry stuffing.

Enright suggests serving this with stews, chowders, fried chicken or
ribs, and also says that this is good with a layered lamb stew.

Jordan Pond House Popovers

breads

2 large eggs
1 cup whole milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup flour, all-purpose (important! sift; before measuring!!)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Beat the eggs at high speed with an
electric mixer for 3 minutes, or until the mixture turns lemon yellow. Slow
the mixer to a crawl and dribble in about 1/2 cup of milk, taking about 20
seconds to pour it in.

Into another bowl, sift the flour and measure 1 cup as exactly as you can,
sift 100 g flour then add salt and baking soda and sift again. With the
mixer still running on its slowest speed, add the dry ingredients to the
eggs and milk. Turn the mixer off and use a rubber spatula to make sure
that all of the flour has blended in with the liquid.

Set the mixer to medium speed and dribble in the remaining milk. Blend for
1 minute. Turn the mixer to its highest speed and beat for 10 minutes (or 5
minutes if you have a Kitchen-aid style mixer that uses a wire whip for
beating).  Extra beating can't hurt.

Filter the batter through a fine-mesh screen strainer to remove any lumps,
then pour into well-buttered popover cups or custard cups. (If you must use
a muffin tin, fill only the 4 corners.) Bake at 425 degrees F. for 15
minutes. Without opening the oven, turn heat to 350 degrees F. and bake for
15 more minutes (20 minutes if your oven door has a window).

Serve immediately, with fresh jam and room-temperature butter.

NOTES:

*  Popovers from the Jordan Pond teahouse -- In Acadia National Park, near
Bar Harbor Maine, is Jordan Pond. A century ago the teahouse at Jordan Pond
was a gathering place where the aristocracy had tea and popovers with
strawberry jam each day at 4 o'clock.

The Jordan Pond Tea House burned down in 1978, but has been rebuilt. It now
serves people sporting clothes announcing "Mommy and Daddy went to
Naugatuck, and all they brought me was this crummy shirt," and who show up
in station wagons, but the popovers are the same that were served to the
idle rich of another era. Yield: 2 large popovers.

*  These popovers turn out significantly better if they are baked in
crockery custard cups rather than in metal or glass.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 30 minutes baking.

Joululimppa (Finnish Holiday Rye Bread)

breads, ethnic

2 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup molasses
1/4 cup butter or margarine
2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon fennel seeds
1 teaspoon caraway seeds
2 tablespoon dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water
1  grated rind of 1 orange
1 cup rye flakes or wheat germ
2 cup dark or light rye flour
3 1/2  to 4 1/2 cups uncleached white or w; hole wheat flour
1  glaze:
1 tablespoon molasses
2 tablespoon water

Similar to Swedish rye.  Can be toasted.

Heat the buttermilk, molasses, butter or margarine, salt, fennel
seeds, and caraway seeds until the butter melts. Set aside to cool.

Dissolve the yeast in the warm water.  Let it stand for 5 minutes
until the yeast bubbles.  ((My comment: whisk in some flour and
molasses to nourish the yeast.)) Add the yeast to the cooled
buttermilk mixture along with the grated orange rind, rye flakes or
wheat germ, and rye flour. Beat well until smooth. Add 3 to 3 1/2
cups of wheat flour, stirring in a cup at a time, until the dough
will not readily absorb more flour. The dough will be rough.

Flour a work surface with the remaining wheat flour and turn the
dough out onto it.  Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest
for 15 minutes. (The gluten in rye is more fragile than in wheat. It
needs a resting time to recuperate and reform and does not require as
vigorous or lengthy a kneading).

Gently knead the dough for 5 to 10 minutes until smooth. Form the
dough into a ball and place it in a large buttered bowl or pot,
turning it to coat all sides with butter. Cover it and let it rise,
in a warm spot, until doubled in size, about an hour.

Punch down the dough and gently knead it for one minute. Form the
dough into three round loaves and place in lightly buttered 9-inch
cake pans or on buttered baking sheets. Cover and let rise until
almost doubled in size, 45 minutes to an hour.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Combine the water and molasses,
brush the tops with half of this mixture to glaze. Then lightly
pierce the loaves all over with a fork.

Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, until the bread sopunds hollow when tapped
on the bottom.  While the bread is hot, brush it with the remaining
glaze. Remove the loaves from the pans and cool on racks.

Yields 3 loaves.

Joyce's Cinnamon Raisin Bread

breads

1 1/4 cup buttermilk
2 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon canola oil*
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon cinnamon
2 cup whole wheat flour
1 1/2 cup bread flour
1 tablespoon vital gluten
2 teaspoon red star active yeast
1 cup raisins; floured

*I may have used only 1 tablespoon of the oil (can't remember).

Since I like a lighter crust, I made this in my Zoji on the "Basic
White Bread" setting with baking degree set on "Light," instead of on
the "Raisin Bread Setting." I floured the raisins and added them 30
minutes after the kneading started.

I know I had to add additional water, until the dough "looked right,"
but I didn't measure it.  I may have added as much as one-fourth cup.

This made a beautiful loaf....almost to the top of the pan. The next
time I make it, I'll try to remember to write down the amounts!

Juji's Naan (Leavened Flat Breads)

breads, indian

3 1/4 cup unbleached white flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cup plain yogurt
1  unsalted butter (optional) - soften; ed

Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a bowl. Slowly add as
much yogurt as you need to gather the flour together and make a soft,
resilient dough. Knead for about 10 minutes and form a ball. Put the
ball in a bowl and cover the bowl with a damp dishcloth. Set aside in
a warm place for 1-1/2 to 2 hours. Knead the dough again and divide
into nine equal parts. Keep them covered.

Heat a cast-iron skillet or griddle over a lowish flame, and preheat
the broiler.

Take one of the parts of dough and make a ball out of it. Flatten it
and then roll out on a lightly floured surface until you have a round
that is about 1/8 inch thick. When the skillet is very hot, pick up
the naan and slap it onto the heated surface.  Let it cook slowly for
about 4 to 5 minutes.  Now put the skillet under the broiler for 1 to
1-1/2 minutes or until the puffing-up process is complete and there
are a few reddish spots on the naan.  Remove the naan with a spatula
and brush with butter if you like.  Make all the naans this way,
keeping them stacked and covered with a clean dishcloth.  Serve hot.

If you wish to have the naans later, wrap them in a plastic bag when
they have cooled.  Before you eat, wrap as many as you need in
aluminum foil and heat in an oven at 400 F for 15 minutes.

Julekage

breads, entertain

1/4 cup warm water
4 tablespoon sugar
1 pkg active dry yeast
1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted and coo; led
1  egg, beaten
2 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cardamom or nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
2  to 5 tbsp evaporated or fresh milk
1 cup dark raisins
1/4 cup finely chopped candied citron
1  vegetable oil
1  egg yolk
2 tablespoon cold water

Makes 1 loaf

Combine water, 1 tablespoon of the sugar and yeast. Stir to dissolve

times. Trun off processor and let dough stand 1 to 2 minutes.

Turn on processor and gradually drizzle in enough remaining milk to
make dough soft, smooth and satiny but not sticky. Process until
dough turns around bowl about 15 times.

Turn dough onto lightly greased surface.  Knead in raisins and citron.
Shape into ball and place in lightly greased bowl, turning to grease
all sides. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let stand in warm
place until doubled, about 1 hour.

Punch down dough.  Roll or pat into circle 8 inches in diameter.
Place in greased 9-inch round cake or pie pan. Brush with oil. Let
stand in warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes.

Heat oven to 350 F.  Beat egg yolk and cold water with fork. Brush

Now, I said above that this makes 48, I've never counted, so I
don't know for sure.  But it sure does make a bunch.  The main
reason why I said 48 is because the program, MenuMaster, won't
let you past that field unless you tell it something.
Justin Wilson says, "Hush puppy is an old Southern term that
originated after the Civil War.  People didn't have enough for
themselves to eat let alone feed their dogs, so when the old
hounds started barking from hunger, they would throw pieces of
fried corn bread to them, yelling, 'Shut up, dog!  Hush puppy!"

Karhi Poori

breads, indian

1 cup flour, whole wheat pastry
1 cup flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon pepper, black; coarse
3 1/2 tablespoon butter, sweet; softened
1 single oil; for frying

Sift the flours and salt into a bowl; add the pepper
and cut in the butter until the mixture resembles
coarse oatmeal. Now slowly add very hot water--about a
half cup plus three tablespoons--and begin to gather
the flour together. Squeeze the dough into a ball. It
should just about hold together. Do *not* knead. Break
the dough into about fifty balls. Keep them covered
with a lightly dampened tea towel. Heat about 1-1/2 to
2 inches of oil in a wok over a medium flame. While
the oil is heating, begin to roll out the pooris. Take
each dough ball, flatten it, and roll it into a very
rough round, about two inches in diameter. (Don't
worry if the edges are ragged or cracked). Roll and
fry as many pooris as the wok will conveniently hold
in one layer. Fry two to three minutes a side, until
the pooris are a very light sandy color on both sides,
and crisp. Crank the heat up or down as needed. Remove
the pooris and drain on paper towels or newspaper (or
both). Allow them to cool and store in an airtight
container. They won't need refrigeration, and should
stay fresh for several weeks or until the end of time.

Kathy Pitts' Turkey & Cheese Sandwich

breads, poultry, cheese

2 slice whole grain bread
1/2  ripe avocado, sliced
1 slice smoked monterey jack or smoked goud; a cheese
1  alfalfa sprouts
1  radish sprouts
1 slice very ripe tomato
1  olive oil
1  wine vinegar
1  fresh ground black pepper

Here's one I invented a lot of years ago for a
vegetarian friend. Not low fat, but it is good (what
can I say, I'm originally from California).

Lay the bread slices on a flat surface.  Put half the
avocado slices on each bread half.  Top one bread half
with the remaining ingredients, dressing this mess
VERY LIGHTLY with oil and vinegar. Top with remaining
avocado/bread half, and cut into quarters to serve.

For a non-vegetarian version of this, I've added thin
slices of smoked turkey.

I've also made this by piling the whole mess into
halves of pita bread, but if you can get good
whole-grain bread, that's even better.

Khoubiz (Lebanese Flat Bread)

breads, lebanese

6 cup plain flour
1 pkg active dry yeast
2 cup warm water
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoon oil

Makes 8 loaves Oven temperature: 260 C (500 F) Cooking
time: 4-5 minutes

Sift flour into a large mixing bowl and warm in a low
oven.

Dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup warm water, add remaining
water and stir in salt and sugar.

Remove about 2 cups flour from bowl and set aside.
Pour yeast liquid into centre and stir in some flour
to make a thick liquid.  Cover with cloth and leave in
a warm place until frothy.

Stir in rest of flour, adding oil gradually, then beat
until smooth, either by hand for 10 minutes, or on
electric mixer using dough hook for 5 minutes.

Sprinkle some of the reserved flour onto a board, turn
out dough and knead for 10 minutes, using more flour
as required.  Dough is ready when it is smooth and
satiny with a slightly wrinkled texture.  Shape dough
into a ball.

Oil bowl, put in dough smooth side down then turn over
so that top is coated with oil.  Stretch plastic wrap
over bowl and leave in a warm place to rise until
almost doubled in bulk -- about 1 to 1-1/2 hours.
Preheat oven.

Punch down dough and turn out onto lightly floured
board.  Knead for a minute or so, then divide into 8
equal pieces, rolling each into a ball.

Roll each piece into a 25 cm (10 inch) round and place
on a lightly floured cloth.  Cover with another cloth
and leave for 20 minutes.

Heat a large baking sheet or flat griddle on the
lowest shelf in an electric oven; in a gas oven select
the section of the oven with the most heat, probably
near the top.

Place a round of dough on a lightly floured baking
sheet with one flat edge or on a piece of plywood,
spreading it evenly.  Shake to ensure that it will
slide off easily.

Rub heated baking sheet or griddle with wad of paper
towel dipped in oil then slide dough onto it.  Bake in
hot oven for 4-5 minutes until it puffs up like a
balloon.  If you would like it browned on top, turn
quickly and leave for a minute.  Remove bread and wrap
in a cloth to keep it warm and soft.  Bake remaining
loaves.

To bake in an electric frypan (a good alternative if
your gas oven does not heat evenly):  Preheat frypan
on highest setting with metal lid on, vent closed.
When heated, oil base quickly and slide dough onto
base. Cover and cook for 3 minutes, remove lid, turn
bread over, re-cover and cook further 2 minutes.

Khoubz Araby (Arab Bread)

breads, bakery

2 3/4 cup lukewarm water
2 pkg active dry yeast
1 pinch sugar
8 cup all purpose flour
2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup olive oil
1 cup cornmeal

Pour 1/4 cup of lukewarm water into a small bowl and
sprinkle it with the yeast and sugar.  Let the mixture
rest for 2 or 3 minutes, then stir to dissolve the
yeast completely.  Set the bowl in a warm, draft free
place (such as a turned off oven) for 5 minutes, or
until the mixture doubles in volume.
In a deep bowl, combine the flour and salt, make a
well in the center, and pour in the yeast mixture, the
olive oil and 2 cups of lukewarm water.
Gently stir the center ingredients together, then
incorporate the flour and continue to beat until the
ingredients are well combined. Add up to 1/2 cup more
lukewarm water, beating it in a tablespoon at a time,
and using as much as necessary to from a dough that
can be gathered into a compact ball. If the dough is
difficult to stir, work in the water with your fingers.
Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead
by pressing it down, pushing it forward several times
with the heel of your hand and folding it back on
itself.  Repeat for 20 minutes, or until the dough is
smooth and elastic.  Shape the dough into a ball and
place it in a lightly oiled bowl.  Drape loosely with
a towel and set aside in the warm place for 45
minutes, or until the dough doubles in bulk. Punch it
down with a blow of your fist and divide it into 8
equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball about 2 1/2
inches in diameter, cover the balls with a towel and
let them rest for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 500
degrees (F).  Sprinkle 2 large baking sheets with 1/2
cup of the cornmeal or flour.  On a lightly floured
surface, roll 4 of the balls into round loaves each
about 8 inches in diameter and no more than 1/8 inch
thick.  Arrange them 2 to 3 inches apart on the baking
sheets, cover with towels and allow them to rest for
30 minutes. If you have a gas oven, bake the bread on
the flour of the oven for 5 minutes, then transfer the
loaves to a shelf 3 or 4 inches above the oven floor
and continue baking for 5 minutes, or until they puff
up in the center and are a delicate brown.  If your
oven is electric, bake the bread on the lowest shelf
for 5 minutes, then raise it 3 or 4 inches and
continue baking until the breads are puffed and
browned. Remove the bread from the baking sheets, wrap
each loaf in foil, and set aside for 10 minutes.
Sprinkle the pans with the remaining 1/2 cup of
cornmeal or flour and bake the remaining 4 loaves of
bread in a similar fashion.
When the loaves are unwrapped the tops will have
fallen and there will be a shallow pocket of air in
their centers.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

1  wheat flour
1 tablespoon dry yeast
1 3/4 cup water
3/4 cup molasses
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon salt
2 teaspoon sugar
2 teaspoon caraway seeds
1 1/2 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
2  med. potatoes, peeled, boiled, mash; ed and cooled

1  instant if you prefer)
1  egg white mixed with 1 tbsp. cold w; ater, for

"Molasses and a tiny bit of cocoa powder gives this
bread its rich, dark color.  This moist, dense-grained
bread, with the texture of the popular imported
pumpernickel you can buy in the gourmet food section
of some stores, is perfect for slicing thinly and
using as a base for canapes. Spread with sweet butter,
it's also a tasty accompaniment to cheese and fruit,
and makes a superior sandwich.  Just remember to slice
it thinly; it's heavy, and a little goes a long way.
Once you try this homemade pumpernickel, you'll never
have to buy it at the supermarket again!"

glaze

Combine 1 1/2 cups of water with the cornmeal in a
saucepan, and cook over low heat, stirring often, till
thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat and
add the molasses, butter, salt, caraway seeds and
cocoa powder. Stir to combine and set aside to cool to
lukewarm.

Warm the remaining 1/4 cup water to approximately 110
degrees, and stir the yeast into it.  Set aside to
proof for 10 minutes.

Put the molasses mixture in a large bowl, and add the
yeast and mashed potatoes.  Stir in the rye flour and
enough whole wheat flour to make a stiff, sticky
dough.  Turn dough out onto a floured work surface,
and knead until elastic and stiff - up to 15 minutes.
You can do this in a mixer attached with a dough hook
if you prefer.

Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat all
sides, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside to rise
for about 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk.  Punch
down the dough, knead for 30 seconds or so, and form
into two smooth balls, or into loaves to fit 8 1/2 x 4
1/2" bread pans. Grease the bread pans, or a baking
sheet, and set loaves in pans or on sheet. Set aside
to rise for 30 minutes or longer, till doubled in bulk.

Brush loaves with egg white glaze.  Bake bread in a
preheated 375 degree oven for 50 minutes, or until it
tests done. Makes 2 loaves.

Flour

Mix the starter, water, yeast and gluten together.
Add 3 cups of the flour.  Cover with a damp towel and
let this sponge sit overnight. The next day, add the
salt, oil, and stir in flour until the dough is a
shaggy mass. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured
counter and knead the dough adding more flour as
necessary until the dough is a smooth ball. The dough
should not be sticky.  Place the dough in a lightly
oiled bowl and let the dough rise for about 2 hours.
The dough should double in size.

Punch down the dough and divide it into 2 pieces.
Knead each piece briefly on a lightly floured counter.
Form each piece into a round ball and place on a
baking sheet that has been greased and sprinkled with
cornmeal. Cover the loaves with a damp towel and let
them rise for 45 to 60 minutes or until slightly
swollen.  While the loaves are fising, preheat the
oven to 375 degrees.  Make 3 slashes that are about 4"
long and 1/2" deep on the top of each loaf. This will
help the loaves to rise evenly in the oven. Bake for
35 minutes or until browned and the bottoms sound
hollow when thumped.

King Arthur - Onion Caraway Sourdough Bread

breads

4 cup king arthur unbleached all-purpose; flour
3 tablespoon sugar
2 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon (or packet) active dry yeast
1 cup milk
2 tablespoon butter or margarine
1 1/2 cup sourdough starter
1  cornmeal to sprinkle on baking shee; t
1  egg white beaten with 1 tbsp. water; , for wash
2/3 cup finely chopped onion

"This recipe was sent to us by Ceil Downey, of
Framingham, Massachusetts, a long-time friend and user
of King Arthur Flour. This recipe contains active dry
yeast, which eliminates the need to develop a sponge.
The onion topping adds zest."

Caraway seeds to spinkle on top of loaves

Making the Dough:  Combine 1 cup of the flour, the
sugar, salt and yeast in a large bowl.  Then, combine
the milk and butter or margarine in a saucepan.  Heat
over low heat until liquid is very warm, 120 to 130
degrees (the butter does not need to melt).

Gradually add the liquids to the dry ingredients,
beating well. Blend in the starter and another cup of
flour.  Beat again. Stir in enough additional flour to
make a soft dough.

Kneading & Rising:  Turn the dough out onto a lightly
floured board and knead until smooth and elastic,
about 10 minutes. Then place it in a greased bowl,
turning the dough to grease the top. Cover and let
rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled, 1 to 2
hours.

Shaping & Rising:  Punch down the dough, turn it out
onto a board and divide it in half (or quarters).
Cover and let rest 15 minutes. Shape into 2 long
loaves (or 4 small round loaves) and place on baking
sheets that have been sprinkled with cornmeal. (For
regular-shaped loaves, place in 2 greased 4 1/2 x 8
1/2" bread pans.)  Cover and let the loaves rise until
doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Baking:  About 15 minutes before you want to bake your
bread, preheat your oven toF«,§XlU"puyÚÏÉ

King Arthur - Sourdough Bread With Yeast

breads

1 1/2 cup lukewarm water
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon (or packet) active dry yeast
1 cup sourdough starter
5 1/2 cup (to 6 1/2 cups) king arthur all-pur; pose flour
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

"Many recipes for sourdough breads include some active
dry yeast to spped up the process, the sourdough
starter included mainly for flavor. We recommend
beginning sourdough bakers start with this bread
before moving on to the Classic Sourdough Bread which
follows. This version makes a quicker loaf with a
slightly different texture and taste, and is a good
introduction to the sourdough process."

cornmeal to sprinkle on baking pans

Making the Sponge:  In a large mixing bowl, dissolve
the sugar and yeast in the warm water.  Let this sit
for 10 minutes or so until bubbly. Add the starter and
stir. Gradually add 3 cups of flour, stirring until
well mixed and smooth.

Cover this sponge and set it aside in a warm,
draft-free place for 4 to 5 hours.

Making the Dough:  Stir down the sponge.  Stir in 1
cup of flour, the salt and oil.  Gradually add flour
until the dough no longer sticks to the sides of the
bowl.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and
knead for 3 to 4 minutes.  Let the dough rest while
you clean and grease your bowl. Continue kneading
another 3 or 4 minutes or until the dough is smooth
and elastic. Add only enough flour to the board to
keep the dough from sticking. Place dough in the
greased bowl and let rise until doubled in bulk, 1 to
2    hours.

Shaping & Baking:  Knock down the dough and shape it
into two long French- or Italian-style loaves.  Place
them on a cornmeal-sprinkled baking sheet and let them
rise for another 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

Toward the end of the rising period, place a baking
pan on the oven bottom (or on the lowest rack) and
preheat your oven to 450 degrees.

Just before baking, slash the tops diagonally every
couple of inches, about 1/4" deep, and brush with cold
water.

Pour 2 or 3 cups of water into the pan, put the loaves
on the rack above the steaming water, and bake for
about 25 minutes.

The crust will be very hard when you remove the bread,
but in 5 minutes it will be soft and chewy.  To make
the crust crisp and chewy, turn the oven off and leave
the bread inside for an additional 5 minutes.

King Arthur's Egg Braid

breads

1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1 cup warm water
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 cup warm milk
4  eggs, room temperature
1  stick butter or margarine
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 tablespoon cinnamon
7 cup 7-9 cups king arthur unbleached all; -purpose flour
12  dyed uncooked eggs
      ----EGG WASH----
1  egg, beaten
1 tablespoon water
1  pinch of salt

Dissolve the yeast in the water. Stir in the sugar and
add 1/2 cup flour. Let this sit for 10-minutes to give
the yeast a chance to get going. Add the milk, eggs,
butter, salt, and cinnamon. Stir in 4 cups of the
flour. Add more flour until the dough starts to form a
shaggy mass. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured
counter and knead it, adding more flour as necessary,
until the dough has formed a smooth and satiny ball.
The dough will be a little tacky, but it shouldn't be
sticky. Put the dough into a clean bowl and coat it
with a little melted butter. This will help prevent
the formation of a skin on the dough due to exposure
to the air. Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a
damp towel. Let the dough rise in a warm spot for 1
1/2 to 2 hours, or until it's quite swollen and puffy
looking. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured
counter and knead it gently to expel any air bubbles.
You don't need to actively knead the dough at this
point; that will excite the gluten in the dough and
make it harder to braid the bread. Divide the dough
into 2 pieces and set one aside. Divide the first
piece into 3 even pieces. Roll each piece into a rope
that is 1" in diameter. Braid the set of ropes and
shape the braid into a large circle. Place the circle
on a greased or parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Repeat with the second piece of dough. Cover the
loaves with damp towels and let the wreaths rise for
30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place the
eggs on the wreaths and gently press them into the
dough. Brush the dough with the egg wash (1 egg beaten
with 1 tbs. water and a pinch of salt). Bake the
loaves for 35-45 minutes, until nicely browned.
Occasionally an egg will split in the oven. Use a
sharp knife to remove it from the wreath and
substitute a dyed-hard-boiled egg. Cool the wreaths on
a rack and ice when fully cool. Makes 2 wreaths, each
yielding 12 large slices. Icing glaze: 1 1/2 cups
confectioners' sugar 3 tbs orange liqueur Beat the
sugar and the liqueur together. The icing should be
the consistency of a thick salad dressing. Use a fork
to drizzle the icing on the wreaths.

anything like the ones I saw posted on the echo the
past few days. The first one is tried and true from my

Kona Inn Banana Bread

breads, fruits

1 cup butter
2 cup granulated sugar
4  eggs; beaten
6  ripe bananas; mashed
2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup macadamia nuts chopped

In a bowl cream the sugar and the butter well until a
light lemon color. Then add the squashed bananas and
the beaten eggs. Stir well until all ingredients are
completely mixed. Sift the flour, the salt and the
baking soda into the creamed mixture then add the
chopped nuts. Again mix until blended but make sure
you do not mix the batter too much. Pre heat the oven
to 350 degrees and when the oven is up to temperature
pour the batter into two prepared loaf pans and bake
for 45 minutes. Before my wife died she often watched
while I was making a mess in her kitchen doing my
imitation of a bakery chef. She said that the Kona Inn
Banana Bread should be renamed Garbage bread because I
never stuck to the recipe and added all sorts of thing
that I found such as any kind of chopped nuts, lemon
and orange zest, chopped apricots, chopped mango,
coconut flakes and one time I even added some
mincemeat that was left over after baking some mince
pies. Perhaps the Kona Inn should have taken me to
court and forced me to stop making changes to their
Banana Bread. Perhaps my use of their name for the
resulting strange flavored versions of their Banana
bread had something to do with their going out of
business some years ago.

Kouloura

breads

3 cup plain flour
1 pkg active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water
1/2 cup warm milk - (water may be substitue; d)
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoon oil
1  sesame seeds

Dissolve yeast in warm water.  Mix in remaining
ingredients except sesame seeds, using more or less
flour, as necessary, to form a workable dough.

Knead dough until smooth; shape into a ball and place
in an oiled bowl. Cover and let rise in warm place
until doubled in bulk.  Punch down and turn out onto a
floured surface to shape.  Form dough into a thick
rope about 20 inches in length, slightly tapered at
each end. Place rope in the shape of a ring on a
greased baking sheet, overlapping and tucking under
ends.  Cover and let rise again.

Preheat oven to 375 F. (190 C.).  Brush bread with
water and sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Bake until
bread is golden brown, about 30 minutes.

Variation - Elioti (Olive Bread):

Prepare 1 quantity of Kouloura dough, as directed
above. During first rising, saute 1 medium onion in 1
tablespoon olive oil until transparent. Lightly smash
1 cup of Greek black olives with a wooden mallet or
knife handle to split; remove pits from olives.  Mix
olives and onions together and let cool.

After punching down dough, turn onto a floured surface
and roll out to form a rectangle about 1/2 inch thick.
Cover rectangle with onion and olive mixture, leaving
a border around edges.  Starting at one long end, roll
up dough and shape into a loaf.  Press edges closed.

Place loaf on a greased baking sheet and slash
diagonally in three or four places.  Cover and let
rise again until double in size.  Bake in a preheated
375 F. (190 C.) oven about 35-40 minutes.

6 tablespoon butter,softened(3/4 stick)
3  eggs
2 tablespoon vanilla
3 tablespoon milk,powdered
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon saffron,ground (optional)
4 3/4 cup flour,all-purpose
1/4 cup almonds,slivered
1/4 cup orange peel,chopped,candied
      ----SUGAR GLAZE----
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1  reserved soaking rum
2 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon water

1. Soak raisins in rum for at least 30 or overnight.

2. Combine 1/2 teaspoon sugar along with yeast and water in small
bowl. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.

3. Beat together remaining sugar, butter, eggs, vanilla, powdered
milk, salt and saffron, if using, and yeast mixture in large bowl
with mixer until blended. Add 2 cups of the flour and 1 tablespoon of
soaking rum, beating for 2 minutes at high speed.

4. Drain raisins and reserve rum for glaze. Stir raisins, almonds and
orange peel into dough with wooden spoon. Stir in enough of remaining
flour to form a soft dough. Turn out onto floured surface and knead
until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.

5. Place dough in greased bowl, turning to coat. Cover; let rise in
warm spot for 1 1/2-2 hours, until doubled. Grease well two 1 lb.
coffee cans. Line bottoms with rounds of waxed paper.

6. Turn dough out onto floured surface. Punch down; knead a few turns.
Divide in half and place in prepared cans. (They should be about
two-thirds full.) Let rise, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, or until
it has risen to top of can.

7. Preheat oven to moderate (350'F). Brush tops of breads lightly with
water.

8. Bake in lower third of preheated moderate over (350'F) for 35-40
minutes or until golden brown on top and long skewer inserted in

Lacto: Naan

breads

3 3/4 cup unbleached,all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cup plain yogurt
1  soft unsalted butter

Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a bowl. Slowly add as
much yogurt as you need to gather the flour together and make a soft,
resilient dough. Knead for about 10 minutes and form a ball [the
dough, not you. -S ] Put the ball in a bowl and cover the bowl with a
damp dishcloth. Set aside in a warm place for 1 1/2 - 2 hours. Knead
the dough again and divide into nine equal parts. Keep them covered.
Heat a cast-ironed skillet or griddle over a lowish flame. Preheat
the broiler. Take one of the parts of dough and make a ball out of
it. Flatten it and then roll it out on a lightly floured surface
until you have a round that is about 1/8 inch thick. When the skillet
is very hot, pick up the naan and slap it onto the heated surface.
Let it cook slowly for about 4 to 5 minutes. It will either puff up
completely or partially. Now put the whole skillet under the broiler
for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes or until the puffing-up process completes
itself and there are a few reddish spots on the naan. Remove the naan
with a spatula and brush with butter if you like. Make all of the
naans this way, keeping them stacked and covered with a clean
dishcloth. Serve hot. If you wish to have the naans later, wrap them
in a plastic bag when they have cooled. Before you eat, wrap as many
as you need in aluminum foil and heat in a 400 degree oven for 15
minutes.

Lavender Shortbread

breads, cookies, flowers, lavender

1 1/2 cup butter (3 sticks)*
1  ; room temperature
2/3 cup sugar
2 tablespoon lavender florets, chopped
1 tablespoon fresh mint, chopped
2 1/3 cup flour
1/2 cup cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt

GARNISH Lavender powdered sugar**

*No substitutes.

**To make lavender powdered sugar, put a few lavender flowers in a
sealed, pint jar of powdered sugar for a day before using sugar.

Preheat oven to 325 F.  Cover two baking sheets with parchment or
brown paper.

In a large bowl with an electric mixer, cream together the butter,
sugar, lavender and mint; mix until light and fluffy, about 3
minutes. Add flour, cornstarch and salt; beat until combined. Divide
dough in half. Flatten into squares and wrap in plastic.  Chill until
firm.

On a floured board, roll or pat out each square to a thickness of
3/8". Cut the dough into 1 1/2" squares or rounds. Transfer to baking
sheets, spacing cookies about 1" apart. Prick each cookie several
times with the tines of a fork.

Bake 20 to 25 minutes until pale golden (do not brown). Cool
slightly, then transfer to a rack. Sprinkle with lavender powdered
sugar. Store in tin cookie boxes or sealed containers.

Yield: About 4 dozen.

Shepherd writes: "A lovely rich shortbread with a hint of sweet

Lavosh

breads

1 pkg yeast, active, dry 1/4 oz
1 1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 cup water, warm 115 f
2 tablespoon water, warm 115 f
3 cup flour, all-purpose
2 oz butter, melted (1/2 stick)
1 tablespoon seeds, sesame, white, or
1  onions, chopped
1  seeds, poppy

Pour the yeast into a clean, small, shallow bowl. Add 1 teaspoon
of the sugar and 1/4 cup of the warm water. Let the mixture stand for
2 to 3 minutes, then stir to dissolve the yeast completely. Place the
bowl in a warm, draft-free place for 5 to 10 minutes or until the
mixture looks foamy and has almost doubled in volume.

Measure your flour into a mixing bowl, and make a well in the
center of the flour.  Pour the yeast mixture into this center
depression, and then add the remaining water, sugar, and melted
butter to the yeast.

Mix the ingredients well with a spoon until a soft, spongy dough
is formed.  Cover the bowl loosely with a warm, damp cloth, and
return it to the warm, draft-free spot until the dough again doubles
in volume, about 45 minutes.

Preheat your oven to 350 F.

When the dough has risen, place it on a lightly floured surface
and divide it into six equal parts. With a lightly floured rolling
pin, roll each part into a flat round about 1/4 inch thick.

Place 2 or 3 rounds on each of two or three cookie sheets. Rub
the surface of the rounds lightly with cool water, and sprinkle each
with 1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds, or other topping. The water will
basically help the toppings to adhere to the rounds when baked.

Bake the rounds in the oven on the bottom rack for about 20
minutes or until the breads are a pale golden brown. (Bake breads in
"shifts" if oven size does not allow entire recipe to be baked at
once.)

With a spatula, transfer the breads to a wire rack to cool.
Breads will keep several days if stored in a dry, air-tight place.

Lefse

breads, christmas

2 cup milk, scalded
1 tablespoon salt
1/2 cup lard
4 cup flour

Add lard, salt and 2 cups flour to scalded milk and mix well over low
heat. Remove from fire.  Sift 2 cups of flour on board, add warm
dough and work in flour. Knead well and cool. This dough can be
rolled immediately or kept in a cool place for a couple of days. May
be stored in a plastic bag. Make a small patty, about hamburger size,
with even sealed edges as you would for pastry.  Flour board lightly
and with a Scandinavian rolling pin roll patty in all directions,
keeping the dough round. Roll lightly, stretching dough until it is
almost as large as the lefse baker. Use pointed stick to handle dough
when it is transferred from the board to the baker. Brown lightly,
prick air bubbles, turn and brown other side. It may be necessary to
change heat control from high to low. This is a soft bread. Serve
with butter, or butter and sugar. (Note: I don't have either a
Scandinavian rolling pin or a lefse baker, so I use a regular rolling
pin and a griddle. This is like a Swedish tortilla! We usually spread
butter and sprinkled sugar over the lefse then rolled them up and
DEVOURED them!)

Lemon Pepper Popovers

breads, low fat

1 cup flour, unbleached white
1 cup skim milk; at room temp
1 tablespoon olive oil, extra virgin
1/4 teaspoon salt; or to taste
1/2 teaspoon black pepper; coarsely ground or cracke
2 teaspoon lemon rind; freshly grated
3 each egg whites; lightly beaten

*Anne's note:I'd omit the salt to reduce the sodium

"These delicious popovers take advantage of lemon's strong affinity
with freshly ground black pepper. They rise best in baked in deep
molds in a very hot oven. One of the best ways to grate lemon peel is
to remove the zest in strips using a vegetable peeler, then grind it
to a powder in a spice mill."

Preheat oven to 450F. Sift the flour into a mixing bowl and gradually
whisk in the milk. Add the remaining ingredients, whisking just to
mix. The mixture should be the consistency of heavy cream. If
necessary, add more milk. Grease popover molds or muffin cups with
vegetable oil spray or a little olive oil. Fill each mold 1/2 full.
Bake for 15 minutes without opening the door. Reduce heat to 375F and
continue baking for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the popovers are
browned. Unmold and serve at once.

1  instant lemon pudding
1 cup water

1  poppyseed
2/3 cup vegetable oil

*(I use Betty Crocker Supermoist) Beat all ingredients, except
poppyseed, until smooth.
Add poppyseed to your taste.  I usually add about 2 Tablespoons but
you can add as much as you like.  I then bake it in a well greased
bundt pan for about 40 minutes at 350 degrees or until a toothpick
comes out clean. If you were using small bread pans you would cut the
baking time down depending on the size of your pans. It makes great
muffins too.

2 tablespoon butter or margarine, room temperatu; re
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup powdered sugar
1/4 teaspoon vanilla
2  to 3 tbsp milk

Makes 1 loaf

Combine 1/4 cup of the water, 1 tablespoon of the granulated sugar and
yeast.  Stir to dissolve yeast and let stand unitl bubbly, about 5
minutes. Stir in egg.

Fit processor with steel blade.  Measure almonds, candied fruit and
raisins into work bowl.  Process on/off 3 or 4 times until mixture is
coarsely chopped. Remove from work bowl and reserve.

Place remaining granulated sugar and lemon rind in work bowl. Process
until rind is minced, 1 to 2 minutes.

Add flour, butter and salt to sugar mixture.  Process until mixed,
about 5 minutes.

Turn on processor and gradually drizzle yeast mixture through feed
tube into flour mixture.  Drizzle just enough of the remaining water
into flour mixture so dough forms a ball that cleans the sides of the
bowl. Process until dough turns around the bowl about 25 times. Turn
off processor and let dough stand 1 to 2 minutes.

Turn on processor and very slowly drizzle in enough remaining water
to make dough soft, smooth and satiny but not sticky. Process until
dough turns around bowl about 15 times.

until mixed.

Turn dough onto large greased cookie sheet.  Shape into a ball. Cover
with inverted bowl or plastic wrap and let stand 20 - 30 minutes.
Roll out to an 8-inch circle. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let
stand in warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes.

Heat oven to 375 F.  Uncover loaf and bake until evenly brown, 25 - 30
minutes.

Remove bread from cookie sheet and place on wire rack. Blend powdered
sugar, vanilla and enough milk to make a smooth mixture thick enough
to spread.  Spread over bread.

3/4 cup chopped walnuts
2/3 cup raisins
1 1/2 tablespoon freshly grated lemon rind

3 tablespoon flour
1/3 cup chopped nuts
3 tablespoon butter or margarine, softened
3 tablespoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1. Sprinkle yeast and 1/2 tsp of the sugar over very warm water in a
1 cup measure.  Stir to dissolve yeast. Let stand until bubbly, about
10 minutes. 2. Combine 2 cups of the flour, salt, lemon rind and the
remaining sugar in a large bowl; make a well in the middle. Beat eggs
and egg yolks in a small bowl just to mix. Pour eggs, yeast mixture
and warm milk into well. Stir liquids into flour until smooth. Beat
well. 3. Add softened butter gradually, beating well.  Stir in 1 more
cup of the flour. Beat until dough leaves the side of the bowl. 4.
Knead on a lightly floured surface; until smooth and elastic, about 8
minutes. 5. Press dough into a buttered large bowl, turn to bring
buttered side up; cover. Let rise in a warm place, 1 1/2 to 2 hours,
or until doubled in volume. 6. While the dough is rising, make Cheese

electric mixer until smooth; beat in egg yolk and sugar. Stir in
lemon rind. 7. Make Crumb Topping: Combine nuts, flour, butter, sugar
and cinnamon in a small bowl. Grease two 8 x 1 1/2 inch pans. 8. When
dough has doubled, punch down, knead in raisins; divide dough into
four equal parts; press two parts into the bottoms and about 1/2 inch
up the sides of the prepared pans; spread each with about 1 cup of
the cheese filling. 9. Shape remaining dough into 2 8-inch circles;
place on top of cheese filling. Press the handle of a spoon into
dough around edges to seal. 10. Sprinkle half the crumb topping over
each. Let rise in a warm place until dough reaches the top of the
pans, about 1 hour. 11. Bake in a preheated 350 F degree oven for 40
minutes; or until the cakes sound hollow when tapped. Cool on a wire
rack. (Place foil loosely over the crumb topping; invert onto rack,
then turn right side up.) Let cool at least 30 minutes before
serving. Sprinkle with powdered sugar.

Limpa

breads, swedish

1 pkg yeast, dry
1 teaspoon sugar, granulated
1/2 cup ; water, warm (100 f.)
2 cup beer; heated to lukewarm
1/2 cup honey; to 1/2 cup
2 tablespoon butter; melted
2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cardamom, ground (opt)
1 tablespoon caraway seeds; crushed, or
3/4 teaspoon aniseed; crushed
2 tablespoon orange peel, fresh or candied; chopped
2 1/2 cup flour, rye
3 cup flour, unbleached

Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the water in a large bowl and proof
for five minutes.  Combine the beer, the honey (adjust for how sweet
you like your bread) butter, and salt, and stir well. Add to the
yeast mixture. Add the spices and orange peel.  Mix the flours, then
add three cups of this mixture to the liquid and beat briskly. Cover
with a tea towel, and let rise in a warm, dark place for about an
hour. Stir down and add enough of the remaining flour to make a
pretty stiff but still sticky dough. Turn out on a very well-floured
board, and work the dough until it is smooth and elastic.  Add more
flour to the board as needed. While the dough will not lose its
tackiness completely it will smooth out a lot. Shape it into a ball,
oil the surface, and place in an oiled bowl. Cover with the tea towel
again and let rise a second time, about one hour. Punch down, shape
into two balls, and put on a greased baking sheet sprinkled with
cornmeal. Brush with melted butter, cover loosely with waxed paper,
and refrigerate for three hours. Remove from the fridge and let sit
on the counter, uncovered, for ten to fifteen minutes. Bake in a 375
F. oven until the bread sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom;
about 40 to 45 minutes. Cool before slicing.

ingredients except the dried fruits to a smooth and elastic dough.
Cover and leave to rise until doubled in size - about 1 hour in a
warm room.

Knock back the risen dough and knead again briefly, gradually
working in the dried fruits until evenly distributed. Divide the
dough in two, shape and put into two small (1 lb) greased and lined
loaf tins. Cover and leave to prove (rise) until puffy and light.

Bake on a preheated baking sheet at 375 F (190 C) gas mark 5 for
40-50 minutes.  Take the loaves out of the tins and return them to
the oven for a further 10 minutes or so as necessary - the bread will
sound hollow when tapped on the base if it is properly cooked. Makes
2 small loaves.

Lisa's Banana Quick Bread

breads

1 1/2 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2  eggs, beaten
3  ripe bananas, mashed
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ginger

Preheat oven to 325. Coat 4 small loaf pans with vegetable cooking
spray. Combine dry ingredients; blend well and set aside.  Combine wet
ingredients; blend well.  Mix together wet and dry ingredients.  Do
not overmix.  Distribute batter among the 4 pans, and bake for 30 to
40 minutes.

Notes:  There was something odd about the taste of this one.  Perhaps
the ginger was a bad choice.

These small loaves freeze well, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, once
completely cooled.  To defrost, set out at room temperature, loosely
wrapped, for about an hour.

These breads are great for making the house smell Autumnal!  They
also make great Christmas gifts for the neighbors.

Little Caesar's Crazy Bread

breads, dressings

1  tube 10 oz pillsbury pizza
1  dough
2 tablespoon butter
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1  kraft 100% grated parmesan
1  cheese

1.  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. 2.  Unroll the dough on a
cutting board.  Position it lengthwise (longer from let to right than
from top to bottom). With a sharp kinfe, cut the dough in half down
the middle. Then cut each of those halves vertically  in half, and
then in half once more so that you have 8 even strips of dough. 3.
Being careful not to stretch the dough, place each strip on a lightly
greased cookie sheet and bake for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the top
just turns golden brown. 4. While the dough bakes, melt the butter
(on the stove or in the microwave on high for 15 to 20 seconds), then
add the garlic salt and stir until it dissolves. 5. Remove the
browned dough from the oven and with a pastry brush or spoon spread a
coating of garlic butter over each piece. 6. Sprinkle a generous
amount of Parmesan cheese on each. Makes 8 pieces.

Louise Frazier's Southern Corn Bread

breads, quick&easy

1 1/2 cup cornmeal -- stone ground
3 tablespoon flour
2 tablespoon sugar
3 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup buttermilk
2  eggs -- well beaten
4 tablespoon dripping

Preheat the oven to 350F. Combine the dry ingredients and stir in the
wet. Pour the mixture into a lightly buttered 8" square pan and bake
for 40 minutes, checking after 30. This is a dense, chewy cornbread
and serves 6 to 8. Again, substitutions can be made: skim buttermilk,
Egg Beaters, and butter substitutes for the dripping and to grease
the pan. Do try to find stone ground cornmeal, though. It gives the
cornbread a wonderful flavor and texture. The batter may also be
fried in a large pan on to p of the stove, flipping it over so both
sides are crunchy.

Low Carbohydrate Waffles

breads, breakfast, low carb

1 cup protein drink mix
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 large egg, separated
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted

Heat waffle iron. Whisk dry ingredients together in a medium bowl.
Whisk yolk with cream, water and butter. Beat egg white until it just
holds a 2-inch peak. Add liquid ingredients to dry ingredients in a
thin steady stream while gently mixing with a rubber spatula; be
careful not to add liquid faster than you can incorporate it. Toward
end of mixing, use a folding motion to incorporate ingredients;
gently fold egg white into batter. Spread appropriate amount of
batter onto waffle iron. Following manufacturer's instructions, cook
waffle until golden brown, 2 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately. (You
can keep waffles warm on a wire rack in a 200-degree oven for up to 5
minutes.) Makes 3 to 4 waffles. NOTES : "If you're out of buttermilk,
try this sweet-milk variation. By making your own baking powder using
baking soda and cream of tartar and by cutting back on the quantity
of milk, you can make a thick, quite respectable batter. The result
is a waffle with a crisp crust and a moist interior." -- Christopher

Luchi (Crisp Fried Bread)

breads, indian, bakery

1 cup all-purpose flour
1 pinch salt
2 tablespoon ghee
2 tablespoon water
1  oil for deep-fat frying

Sift together the flour & salt.  Mix in the ghee & add then add just
enough water to make a stiff dough. Knead very well for 10 to 15
minutes. Divide the dough into 20 balls, cover & set aside for 20
minutes.

Roll out each ball on an unfloured board into small, flat, thin
circles. If the dough is stiff, try lightly greasing the rolling pin.
Roll each luchi as thinly as possible. If you make puri, roll them
out thinner than you would when making puri.

Heat 2 or 3 inches of oil in a skillet or wok until it is very hot.
Drop the luchi into the hot oil & press down lightly with the back of
a spoon. They will puff up exactly like puri. Drain & serve
immediately.

Making The Loaf

breads

:  directions only

Making the Loaf

Kneading

Kneading develops the gluten in the flour to form a framework for
holding the gases given off by the yeast. The KitchenAid mixer not
only effortlessly tackles kneading but provides the constant rhythm
necessary for best results. After all the flour has been added,
continue to knead for approximately 2 minutes until the dough is
smooth and satiny, not sticky. Shape the dough into a ball and place
in an oiled bowl. Brush the top of the dough with additional oil to
prevent a crust from forming while rising. Cover the bowl with a
towel or plastic wrap and let rise in a warm (70 degrees F to 85
degrees F) place, free from drafts.

Rising

Let the dough rise until double in size. To test the dough, depress
two fingers into the center and if the dent stays, it has doubled.
Punch the dough down by pushing your fist into the center of the
dough and pulling the edges over to the center. Turn the dough over.
Letting the dough rise a second time before shaping will yield a
finer textured loaf.

Shaping

There are many ways to shape a loaf. Specialty breads, such as braids
or rolls, will generally include directions in the recipes. Two
simple methods for shaping standard loaves are as follows:

Form the dough into an oval the size of the pan, stretching and
turning ends of the dough under and pinching into a seam. Place in
prepared pan, seam side down. Roll the dough into a rectangle
slightly longer than the size of the pan. Beginning with the shorter
side, roll dough towards you. Seal long seam as well as ends with
hands. Fold sealed ends under and place loaf, seam side down, into
prepared pan.

Baking

Place loaves in the center of the oven, leaving space for the heat to
surround the pans. To check for doneness, remove one loaf from its
pan and tap the bottom. If it sounds hollow it is done. Turn loaves
onto racks immediately after baking to prevent sogginess.

Bread Making Tips

1.Always store flour in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.
For long-term storage, store flour and yeast in refrigerator or
freezer. 2.To measure flour, spoon it lightly into a dry measuring
cup and level with a spatula. 3.Use the Grain Mill to grind whole
wheat berries and other grains into flour. One cup of grain yields
approximately 1-1/4 cups of flour, except for rolled oats which
yields 7/8 cup of flour. 4.Always check liquid temperature with an
accurate thermometer.

5.Allow bread to rise in a warm, draft-free place. Place bowl of
dough on rack over pan of warm water. Or, set oven on lowest setting
for 10 minutes. Turn oven off and place bowl of dough in oven. 6.For
soft crusts and extra shine, brush finished bread with melted butter
and cool uncovered. 7.For crispier crusts, brush loaves with a
mixture of one egg white and one tablespoon of cold water before
baking. 8.Inverting finished bread onto racks immediately from oven
prevents a soggy loaf. 9.Some large recipes and soft doughs may climb
over the collar of the dough hook. This indicates the dough needs
more flour. The sooner all the flour is added, the less likely the
dough is to climb the hook. Try starting with all but the last cup of
flour in the initial mixing process. Then add the remaining flour as
quickly as possible, never exceeding the total amount given in the
recipe. 10.Dough made with whole grain flour may not form a ball on
the dough hook during kneading. However, as long as there is contact
between the hook and the dough, kneading will be accomplished.
11.Allow bread to cool completely before slicing. 12.Baked yeast
breads may be stored in the freezer for up to six months. Wrap
securely in plastic wrap or aluminum foil. To thaw, let stand at room
temperature for 3 hours.

2 tablespoon malt extract *
3 medium eggs, slightly beaten
3 oz wholemeal self raising flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
8 oz dried mixed fruit
2 teaspoon caster sugar to sprinkle
1  spiced butter to serve**

*Malt extract is a dark syruup available in jars from most health food

base-line with greased greaseproof paper. Place the brown sugar,
butter and malt extract in a large bowl and beat well until pale &
fluffy. Gradually beat in the eggs, 1 Tbsp at a time. Sift the flours
and cinnamon into the creamed mixture (making sure any bran remaining
in the sieve from the wholemeal flour is also tipped into the bowl.)
Using a metal spoon, gently fold in the flours and cinnamon, followed
by the dried fruit. Spoon the mixture into the tin. Bake in the oven
for 1 hr. 10 min. until a skewer inserted into the cake comes out
clean. Cover the top of the cake if it is browning too quickly. Leave
to cool in the tin for 5 min. then turn out on to a cake rack and
allow to cool completely. Sprinkle with sugar and serve with spiced
butter if liked.

2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/4 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/3 cup chopped blanched almonds
2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (less needed

Beat the eggs and sugar together until thick.  Add the oil and

Pour the batter into a lightly oiled and floured 9 x 5 x 3 inch loaf
pan just to cover the bottom of the pan.

Sprinkle on the cinnamon.  Add another layer of batter and cinnamon.
Continue until all the batter and cinnamon are used.

Bake in 350 F oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Bread
will be dense.  Remove from the pan and cool on a wire rack. Cut into
1/2 inch slices when ready to serve. Place each slice on a lightly
oiled baking sheet and toast in a 400 F oven for 5 to 6 minutes. (My
note - warm briefly in microwave.)

1 cup boiling water
1 cup scalded milk
1/3 cup maple syrup
2 teaspoon salt
2 cup whole wheat flour
1 tablespoon quick rise instant yeast
1  egg, beaten
2 cup all-purpose flour

in a large mixing bowl, combine the rolled oats and butter. Pour
boiling water over and stir until butter melts. Add scalded milk,
maple syrup and salt. Let mixture cool slightly until warm to the
touch (if using a thermometer, temperature should read 125 - 130
degrees). Stir in whole-wheat flour, yeast and egg; beat vigorously
with a wooden spoon until smooth. Stir in enough all-purpose flour to
make a stiff dough. Turn out on floured board and knead, sprinkling
surface with additional flour to prevent dough from sticking, until
smooth and elastic, about 8 - 10 minutes. Shape into a ball and place
a lightly buttered bowl; turn to coat dough on all sides with butter.
Cover with a clean dry towel and let rise for
30    minutes. Punch down dough and divide in half. Shape into
loaves and place in 2 greased 8 1/2 by 4 1/2 inch loaf pans. Brush
tops of loaves with melted butter. Cover and let rise in a warm place
until double in bulk -- about 35 - 45 minutes. Bake in an oven

Contributed to the echo by: Debra Heng Originally from: Mom's Polish

Well, I finally found that recipe I told you about, and another one
that's slightly different. Neither is anything like the ones I saw
posted on the echo the past few days. The first one is tried and true
from my mom's Polish neighbor. The second is from the folks who make
the Solo filling.

MARIANNE'S KOLACKIES

Cream butter and cream cheese together. Add egg, vanilla; then mix in
the flour. Cover and chill for a few hours to overnight. Roll out on
lightly floured board to 1/4" thickness and cut with round cookie
cutters. Place them on a cookie sheet as you would cookies. Use thumb
to make indentation in center of each. Fill with about 1 tsp of
desired filling. Bake at 350 F until lightly golden, about 10-15
minutes (guessing here, I just do it by sight).

Marti's Whole Wheat Bread

breads

12 cup whole wheat flour(up to 14 cups)
2 tablespoon dry yeast; heaping
1/2 cup high gluten flour
500  mg vitamin c
5 cup warm water (120-130*)
1 cup plain yogurt
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup honey

1 1\2 tb Salt

In mixer bowl equipped with kneading arm put ingredients in in this
order: water, yeast, honey, oil, yogurt, 9 cups ww flour, high gluten
flour, vitamin C and salt. Pulse a few times to mix. Turn mixer on,
and quickly add remaining flour, one cup at a time, until dough forms
a ball and cleans the side of the bowl. The amount of flour may vary.
Knead 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 200 during this time. Lightly oil
hands. Divide dough into equal portions. Shape into loaves and place
in greased (I also flour) bread pans. Turn off oven. Place bread in
oven, arranging pans with space between to allow heat to circulate
freely. Set a kitchen timer and watch closely. Let rise until almost
double in bulk, approx. 15-30 minutes. Leave bread in oven and turn
heat to 350, baking 30-35 minutes. Immediately remove from pans; let
cook on wire racks. This is adapted from Set For Life. This is how I
make it and the bread is moist, scrumptous.

Marty's Pizza Dough

breads, main dish, italian

4 1/4 cup flour
1 1/2 cup water, lukewarm (105 to 115
1  degrees fahrenheit)
1 pkg active dry yeast
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoon olive oil

Put flour into a large bowl and make a deep well in the middle. Pour
warm water into the well, mix in the yeast, using a bit of flour in
the mix. Add the sugar, salt, and flour to the well, let stand for 10
minutes until mixture bubbles. Slowly stir all of the flour into the
yeast mixture. When it gets too thick to handle place it on a board
and knead it until elastic. Form a ball, place into a greased bowl,
then turn it over so the top of the ball is greased. Cover with a
towel and let rise in a warm and draft free place for an hour or
until double in bulk. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Punch down dough
and divide in half. Refrigerate one half for later. (Allow extra time
to rise). Roll the other half into a circle about 15 inches across.
Place on a 14 inch greased pizza pan, roll edges to form a rim.

Spread half the sauce on the pizza pie (see recipe), top with shredded
mozzarella, and other favorite toppings (mushrooms, olives, pepperoni,
etc). Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until edges are brown and cheese is
bubbly. Cut each pie into 6 wedges.

Mary Rogers's Sourdough Biscuits

breads

1/2 cup active starter
1 cup milk
2 1/2 cup flour
1/3 cup lard or shortening
1 tablespoon sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar

At bedtime make a batter of the half cup of starter, cup of milk, and
1 cup of the flour.  Let set overnight if the biscuits are wanted for
breakfast. If wanted for noon, the batter maybe mixed in the morning
and set in a warm place to rise.  However, unless the weather is real
warm, it is always all right to let it ferment overnight. It will get
very light and bubbly. When ready to mix the biscuits, sift together
the remaining cup and a half of flour and all other dry ingredients
except the baking soda.  Work in the lard or shortening with your
fingers or a fork.  Add baking soda dissolved in a little warm water
to the sponge and then add the flour mixture. Mix into a soft dough.
Knead lightly a few times to get in shape.  Roll out to about 1/2
inch thickness or a little thicker,and cut with a biscuit cutter.
Place close together in a 9 x 13-inch pan, turning to grease tops.
Cover and set in a warm place to rise for about 45 minutes.  Bake in
a 375 degree oven for about 30 to 35 minutes.  Leftovers are good
split and toasted in a sandwich toaster.

Maryetta's Italian Sausage Bread

breads, clay pot

1 lb italian sausage, sweet
1 1/4 cup water; lukewarm
1 teaspoon salt
1 pkg dry active yeast
1 pinch saffron
1 tablespoon fennel seeds
4 cup all-purpose flour; sifted
5 teaspoon olive oil
1  cornmeal

If you think your sausage has too much fat, simmer in shallow water
in a frying pan, pricking the sausage with a sharp knife to allow the
fat to escape.

Combine the lukewarm water, salt, yeast, saffron, and fennel seeds in
a metal cup and maintain a lukewarm temperature to keep the yeast
active. Sift the flour into a large bowl, and make a well in the
center of it. Pour in the yeast mixture and mix well (you will have
to use your hands). Knead the dough until smooth and elastic (about
10 minutes), then pour the oil over the dough and knead until no
longer sticky (about 5 minutes). Place in a large bowl, cover with a
towel, and put in a warm place until it doubles in size. (Press the
dough with your fingertips; if they leave a stubborn imprint, it has
risen enough.)

When the rising time is almost over, presoak a clay pot, top and
bottom, for 15 minutes.

Roll the dough out to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Place the sausages
(about 5) on top of the dough, wrap each in its own pocket, and pinch
the ends closed. Place each pocket side by side to form one loaf.
Trim a piece of aluminum foil, cover the bottom of the bottom of the
presoaked pot and sprinkle with cornmeal. Add the dough to the pot
and put lid on, then put the covered pot in a warm place and let the
dough rise until doubled in size (about 60 minutes).

Cover the pot and place it in a cold oven.

Set the oven temperature at 450 degrees F.

Bake for 45 minutes, then check the bread and let it continue baking,
uncovered, in the oven to brown for an additional 15 minutes (total
cooking time about 60 minutes). The bread will be done when a finger
thump on the loaf's surface sounds hollow.

Allow the bread to sit for 15 to 20 minutes before serving.

NOTE: This recipe can be safely doubled, but use 2 pots for cooking.

Masa Sovada (Portuguese Sweetbread)

breads

1/4 cup water (warm for dry; lukewarm for compressed)
1 cup scalded milk
1 cup sugar
2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1/2 teaspoon of salt
5 1/2  to 6 cups all-purpose flour
4  eggs
1  2 packages yeast (active dry or com; pressed)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Dissolve yeast in warm water.  Scald milk and add to sugar, butter and
salt; stir until butter is melted. Mix cinnamon and flour. Add 1/2 the
flour to the milk/sugar/butter/salt, and mix until smooth. Beat 3
eggs and add them and the yeast to the mixture.

Continue to add remaining flour to make soft dough. Remove it from
the bowl and place on floured board. Knead until smooth and satiny
(about 15 mins.). Shape into a ball and place in buttered bowl. Cover
and let rise until double in size (2-1/2 to 3 hours).

Punch risen dough down and divide it in half.  Place in two greased
pans (8 inches round).  Let rise in warm place until double in size
(1-1/2 to 2 hours). Brush tops of dough with remaining egg (beaten).

Bake in 350 degree oven for 20-30 minutes or until golden brown. Cool
on wire racks.

NOTES:  I have found that if I initially heat up the oven and then
turn it off, I put the dough in there to rise and it rises twice as
fast.

Also, I don't know if this violates any rules, but I've found that I
prefer this bread with raisins added.

Finally, as I mentioned to those who have gotten this recipe already,
this bread makes the best toast in the world! (Personal opinion, of
course..)

Another untried recipe, offered as ransom for recipes stolen,
off-topic postings, and ill received boasting about Texas.......

Recipe quoted from Elena's Secretes of Mexican Cooking, Elena Zelayeta

"This dessert is usually served during Lent.  The combination of
cheese and fruits may sound strange, but it's extremely popular in
Mexico and I know many Americans who rave over it.

Boil water, sugar, stick cinnamon an dclove together until syrupy.
Butter a casserole generously and put in a layer of bread or cake
cubes. Cover with a layer of banana or apple slices and sprinkle with
some of the raisins, peanuts, almonds and cheese cubes. Repeat the
layers until all ingredients are used. Remove stick cinnamon and
clove from syrup and pour syrup over

NOTES:

*  Corn Bread with peppers and cheese -- I got this recipe from net.cooks
in the fall of 1983. It's really good! We always make a batch of Mexican
cornbread when we cook chili; it's also a good dinner with just a salad and
the beer of your choice.  The original recipe came from akgua!akguc!mah.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 90 minutes baking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

Mexican Tortillas

breads, mexican, ethnic

225 gm polenta (maize meal)
1 teaspoon salt
225 gm plain white flour
25 gm lard or margarine
300 ml warm water

Mix the maize meal, salt and white flour in a large bowl, add the
lard or margarine and rub in until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
Add the water and mix to a dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly
floured surface and knead for a short time until smooth. Shape the
dough into 4 equal balls, roughly the size of a tennis ball, and let
them rest for about an hour covered with a damp tea towel. Roll each
ball out thinly on the floured surface to a circle about 25cm (10
inch) in diameter.

Heat an ungreased griddle or large frying pan and fry the maize meal
pancakes over a fairly high heat, turning them over so they are
lightly brown on each side.

Variations.

The tortilla is a multi-purpose bread and can be served as it is, a
thin, flat cornbread to accompany food. It can also be used as a
platter or scoop for thick meat or bean mixtures. It can be fried on
one side only and rolled round a chilli-and-bean stuffing to become a
Taco, or stuffed, sometimes fried and coated in sauce when it is
known as an Enchillada. Finally, it can be sprinkled with sweet
mixtures and served as a pudding.

Millet Loaf

appetizers, breads, main dish, vegetarian

1 1/2 cup millet
3 3/4 cup water
2 teaspoon sea salt
1 1/2 cup peeled, finely diced carrots
1 cup finely diced celery
1 cup finely diced onions
1  garlic clove; minced
2 tablespoon sesame oil
1 1/2 teaspoon dill weed
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 cup pistachio nuts (optional) or- roast; ed sunflower seeds
3 tablespoon unbleached flour
3 tablespoon gluten flour

You can serve this versatile loaf for lunch or as an appetizer. Place
slices on a bed of Bibb lettuce with vegetable garnishes and a light,
creamy salad dressing.
************************************************** *********

Rinse the millet and put it in a medium saucepan with the water and
1/2 teaspoon sea salt.  Cook the millet, covered, over medium heat
for about 30 minutes or until soft; the millet should absorb all of
the water. (If the grains are too moist, the loaf will not bind
properly.)

Saute the carrots, celery, onions, and garlic in oil for 6 minutes, or
until the onions are translucent. Add the seasonings, including the
remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt. Mix the cooked millet and the
vegetables together, along with the nuts or seeds, if you wish. Mix
the two flours together and add them to the millet mixture, blending
it well so the loaf will hold together.

Lightly oil and flour a large loaf pan.  Press the millet mixture
into the pan and bake in a preheated oven at 400 degrees F for about
one hour. (If the millet mixture is warm when you put it in the pan,
reduce the baking time to about 45 minutes.)  Allow the loaf to cool
for 10 minutes, then carefully remove it from the pan. To avoid
breaking the loaf, you may wish to slice it while it is still in the
pan.

Molasses & Ginger Scones

breads

1 7/8 cup whole wheat flour; -or-
2 cup unbleached white
2 tablespoon brown sugar, firmly packed
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ginger
4 tablespoon butter; cut into bits
1 large egg; beaten
2 tablespoon molasses
1/2 cup lowfat yogurt
1/4 cup raisins

PREHEAT OVEN TO 425F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment. Using a
wooden spoon, mix the flour, sugar, baking soda and powder and ginger
together. Stir in the butter, then the egg, followed by the molasses,
yogurt and raisins. Mix until too thick to stir. Flour a flat surface
and turn the dough onto it. Form the dough into a ball and knead
until it holds together nicely, adding flour if the dough sticks to
your hands. The dough should be slightly tacky. Pat the ball down to
1/2-inch thickness, and cut hearts from it. Place the hearts on the
cookie sheet and bake until golden brown and firm, about 15 minutes.
Serve with jam and tea. Makes 6 large heart-shaped scones.

Mom's Popovers

breads, quick bread

1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup flour
1 cup milk
2 large eggs
1 tablespoon butter, melted

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Grease 2 heavy (cast iron) muffin
pans and put in oven to get hot.

Sift together flour and salt.  Beat eggs with rotary beater; add milk
and butter.  Sift in flour, beating only enough to make a smooth
batter. Fill hot, greased muffin pans 1/3 full. Bake at 450 degrees
for 30 minutes, then lower temperature to 350 degrees and bake about
15 to 30 minutes, or until firm, brown and "popped." KEEP OVEN DOOR
CLOSED WHILE BAKING!

VARIATIONS:

*  Daddy substitutes meat juice from roasts for the milk (like
Yorkshire Pudding).  Don't add salt; if there is any fat in the
juice, that should go toward the tablespoon of butter.

*  For a cheese version, add 1 more egg and 2 T more butter. When
water sizzles on hot pan, pour 1 T batter into each cup and sprinkle
each with 1 teaspoon shredded cheddar; fill cups with rest of batter
till 3/4 full. (Uses a total of 1/4 C cheese.)

*  For a variation with pecans, add 1/3 C, chopped. Cook at 475
degrees for 15 minutes, then at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.

*  For eggnog popovers, add 1 T dry, instant eggnog, 1 T rum and 1/4 t
nutmeg.  (For only 6 popovers.) Follow cooking instructions for
Caraway Rye Popovers...

*  Caraway Rye:  Decrease flour, substitute w/ 1/4 C rye flour. Add
1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds.  (For only 6 popovers.) Cook at 400
degrees just till crusts are very firm; prick with fork to let steam
escape and return to oven (turned off) 5-10 minutes to crisp.

Mondel Bread

breads, cakes, desserts

1 cup sugar
3  eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup oil
1 1/2 cup walnuts or pecans
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
2 cup flour

Mix sugar and eggs in Mix Master.  Add the oil. Remove from the mixer
and proced by hand.  Add [finely chopped] nuts into the mixture and
add the other ingredients into the mixture with a wooden spoon.
Mixture must not be too soft not too stiff so you can roll it into a
salami shape.

Place rolls on a cookie sheet in a 350 [f] oven until golden brown.
Remove from the oven and cut into diagonal slices. Return to oven for
about 15-20 minutes.

I find that I have to chill it over night and add flour to each roll
so it will stand up as a roll and not flatten out-sometimes as much
as a cup or even more depending on the size of the eggs. Submitted By

Monkey Bread - Cooking Light *Jb

breads, desserts, low fat

2  loaves (1-pound) frozen white bread; dough
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/4 cup 1% low-fat milk
1 tablespoon reduced-calorie stick margarine
1 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1  vegetable cooking spray

1 Because the dough has a tendency to drip as it bakes, I usually put
a cookie sheet or aluminum foil underneath the Bundt pan. That way I
don't have to clean up a mess in the oven when the bread has finished
baking. -- Rita M. Newton, Waukon, Iowa

2 Thaw dough in refrigerator for 12 hours. Combine 1 cup sugar and
the next 4 ingredients in a small saucepan; bring to a boil, and cook
1 minute. Remove sugar syrup from heat; let cool 10 minutes.

3 Cut each loaf of dough into 24 equal portions. Combine 1/4 cup
sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a shallow dish; stir well. Roll
each portion in sugar mixture, and layer dough in a 12-cup Bundt pan
coated with cooking spray. Pour sugar syrup over dough; cover and let
rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 35 minutes or
until doubled in bulk.

4 Uncover, and bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes or until lightly
browned. Immediately loosen edges of bread with a knife. Place a
serving plate, upside down, on top of the pan, and invert bread onto
the plate. Remove the pan, and drizzle any remaining syrup over the
bread.

breads

1  bag of frozen rolls (24)
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 pkg vanilla pudding (not instant)
1/2  to 1 c nuts
1  stick of margarine or butter
1 1/2 tablespoon cinnamon

Grease a bundt pan or tube pan with shortening, Place rolls evenly in
pan. Pour melted butter over rolls. In a bowl, mix the remaining
ingredients. Sprinkle over rolls, cover with plastic and let sit over
night or 6-8 hours...Hint, make sure nuts are not on the outside
edges as they will get pushed out...I found that mixing the dry
ingredients between and around the rolls works best...Put a liner
under pan in oven...can make a mess...Butterscotch Pudding can be
used...

More Fillings For Tassies

breads

6 1/2 tablespoon sugar
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup lemon juice
2  eggs
1/4  to 1/2 tsp lemon peel

SOURCE: Natl Cooking Echo 19 Jun 90

Contributed to the echo by: Debra Heng

I haven't made these lemon ones yet, but I scaled down a larger
recipe from some cookbook to resemble the pecan tassie proportions,
hoping to have enough lemon filling for a batch of tartlets. So it
may or may not be enough, thought I'd let ya know.

LEMON TASSIE FILLING

In a small saucepan over low heat, cook the 1 st three until
dissolved. Beat the eggs with a mixer and add the hot mix very
slowly, mixing constantly. Then return mix to the saucepan and cook
for about 3 minutes until it's of pudding consistency. Stir in lemon
peel. Let cool to room temp. Fill each tartlet with about 2 tsps of
the lemon mix. Bake at 350 F for 20-25 mins., or until golden.

The back of the tart tamper package also suggested some other
fillings, like cherry or blueberry pie filling, or vanilla pudding
topped afterwards with a strawberry or a few blueberries (glaze with
some heated currant jelly).

Or make hors d'oeuvres by filling with your favorite quiche recipe, or

More Rice Breads

breads

5 1/2 cup brown rice flour (830 g)
1/2 cup garbanzo flour (70 g)
1 tablespoon salt (16.5 g)
2 2/3 cup tepid water (635 ml)
4 teaspoon active dry yeast (1/2 oz or 14 g)
1/2 cup warm water (120 ml)
2 tablespoon honey (30 ml)
1/4 cup oil (60 ml)
1/4 cup methocel (28 g)

The next two (also from Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book) use the previous
recipe as a basis, with just a few changes.

GARBANZO RICE BREAD

This bread has a mellower flavor and keeps better than the plain
Brown Rice Bread.

Follow the mixing and rising instructions for Brown Rice Bread. Use
only two loaf pans and bake slightly longer, about 50 minutes to an
hour.

SOY-RAISIN RICE BREAD

Denser, cakier, more filling, this bread adds variety and interest.
The slice is golden in color and soft, almost like pound cake.

6 cups brown rice flour (600 g) 2 tablespoons soy flour (7 g) 1
tablespoon salt (16.5 g) 2 2/3 cups tepid water (635 ml) 4 teaspoons
active dry yeast (1/2 oz or 14 g) 1/2 cup warm water (120 ml) 1/3 cup
honey (80 ml) 1/4 cup oil (60 ml) 1/2 cup raisins (70 g) 1/4 cup
methocel (28 g)

Mix and let rise like Brown Rice Bread, incorporating the soy flour
into the first mixing and the raisins along with the honey. Divide
the dough into two loaves only, and bake cooler and longer, at 325
deg.F. for 50 to 60 minutes, or until done.

More Sourdough Starter

breads, meats

1 cup water,
1 cup sugar, and
1/2 cup potato flakes.

Now the starters.  This is the starter that Connie used. After that
is an alternative for people who have trouble with the first one.

Potato starter I:

Mix the ingredients.  Cover loosely and leave in a warm place, such
as on top of a water heater, for 3 or 4 days. If the mixture starts
to smell yeasty prior to 3 or 4 days, or is ready. Go ahead and feed
it and start making bread.  See the feeding directions below. This is
from the "Panola COunty Heritage Cookbook".

For people who have trouble cultivating wild yeast, this is an
alternate starter recipe.

Potato starter II: 2 evelopes (2 TBSP) active dry yeast, 1/2 cup warm
water (105 to 115 F), 1 cup warm water (105 to 115 F), 2/3 cup sugar,
and 3 TBSP instant potato flakes.

Dissolve the yeast in 1/2 cup warm water in a medium mixing bowl.
Stir in 1 cup warm water, sugar, and potato flakes.

Let the mixture sit out all day, then refrigerate 10 to 15 days. (A
10 day schedule works fine.)  Remove from refrigerator and feed, see
the feeding instructions below.  Now you are ready to use 1 cup of
the starter to make bread.

Return the rest of the starter to the refrigerator for another 5 to 10
days.  Before making your next batch of bread, feed the starter again.

Now that we have a starter, we need to feed it.

Feeding Recipe: Starter from recipes above, 1 cup water, 3/4 cup
sugar, and 3 TBSP instant potato flakes.

Into starter, stir ingredients well and keep at room temperature for
10 to 12 hours.

Makes 2 - 3 cups.

*Sometimes more... Howard made this just last month in honer of his
Dad at JAKE'S in Londonderry, VT.  It is truly 'baaad'and Mort
promised he would eat it only at the restaruant.

TAke all the ingredients except the bread and put through the blender
or FP. Spray with Pam (at this point, who cares) or butter a 8"
square pan. Pour a bit of the batter in the bottom of the pan and put
4 slices down and pour about half the batter over the bread. Then 4
more slices and the rest of the batter.

Sprinkle with cinnamon and bake at 350 degrees for about 3/4 hour.
Pour the batter at least 1 hour before baking and as much as
overnight. Please refigerate. Howard stuffed the bread with extra
chuncks of cream cheese....but why not fruit like apples or banana
slices???? You could add some brown sugar to the batter and a dash of
vanilla. We didn't, but served with VERMONT MAPLE SYRUP. Converted by

Mrs. Elizabeth Ovenstad's Bread

breads

2 cup boiling water
1/2 cup whole-wheat kernels, or wheat berri; es
1/2 cup warm water
1 tablespoon sugar
2 pkg active dry yeast
1/3 cup rye flour
1/3 cup whole-meal, whole-wheat flour
6  to 7 cups white flour
1 tablespoon salt
1 cup of warm milk
1 cup of warm water
1  instructions
1  pour:
2 cup boiling water
1  over:
1/2 cup whole-wheat kernels, or wheat berri; es,
1  (available in health food stores)
1  allow to stand for an hour or two t; o soften the berries.
1  proof the yeast as follows:
1/2 cup warm water
1 tablespoon sugar
2 pkg active dry yeast
1  while the yeast is proofing, combin; e in a bowl:
1/3 cup rye flour
1/3 cup whole-meal, whole-wheat flour
3 cup white flour
1  drained wheat kernals
1 tablespoon salt
1  add:
1  proofed yeast mixture from above
1 cup warm milk
1 cup warm water
1  (note that you may use the water th; at was used to soak the
1  wheat berries.)
1  knead well, adding additional:
1  white flour

Another recipe from James Beard's book, "Beard On Bread". About this
bread James Beard says, "I learned to make this bread in Norway, at
Mrs Ovenstad's farm near Oslo. She bakes it twice a week, and though
she resorts to heating the dough over steam for the second rising, it
comes out beautifully. She is also a deft pastry cook and gardner,
and loves to eat. (2 large Loaves)"

about 1/2 cup at a time.  You may need to add 3 more cups, give or
take a bit.

Form into a ball, place into a greased bowl, turn and cover. Allow to
rise until doubled in bulk, probably about 1 hour.

Punch down and knead 10 minutes, then cut into two equal pieces, form
loaves, and allow to rise again.

You may elect to allow the bread to rise a second time in the bowl.
If so, James Beard feels that the bread may need some help in the
second rising, in the form of a bit of heat. I am not so sure, as
this was a very willing bread dough.  Then again, I almost always
rise my bread in a Microwave oven anyway.

As to baking, this bread requires about 1 hour in a 400ø F. oven.

This bread should have a good crunchy crust.

I have made this loaf without the wheat berries, as the crust and
bread is delightful without the berries, and some members of the
family refer to soft berries as "erasers" and hard berries as "rocks"
~ refusing to eat bread with either.  However, with a bit of
practice, you will be able to use the wheat berries at the right
point so they will be neither "rocks" or "erasers".

Muffins & Crumpets (Mrs. Beeton's)

breads

1 quart water
2 oz yeast
1/2 lb potatoes
1/2 oz salt

Makes 24 Muffins or Crumpets

flour

MUFFINS: Wash, peel and boil the potatoes, rub through a colander,
add the water (just warm enough to bear the hand in it without
discomfort); then dissolve the yeast and salt in it, and stir in
sufficient flour to make a moist paste. Beat it well in a deep bowl
and then clear off the paste from the hands; cover over with a clean
cloth and leave it to rise in a warm place. When it has well risen,
and is light and spongy, turn it out on the table, dredge over with
flour, and then divide it off into pieces about 3 oz in weight, roll
them up into round shapes, and set them on a wooden tray, well dusted
with flour to prove. When light enough, see that the hot plate is
hot, and then carefully transfer the muffins from the tray, one at a
time, using a thin tin slice for the purpose, taking particular care
not to knock out the proof or the muffins will be spoilt. When they
have been properly cooked on one side, turn over with the slice and
cook the other side. When the muffins are done, brush off the flour,
and lay them on a clean cloth or sieve to cool.

To toast them, divide the edge of the muffin all round by pulling it
open to the depth of about 1 inch with the fingers. Put it on a
toasting fork and hold it before a clear fire till one side is nicely
browned, but not burnt; turn, and toast it on the other. Do not toast
them too quickly, otherwise the middle of the muffin will not be
warmed through. When done, divide them by pulling them open; butter
them slighlty on both sides, put them together again, and cut them
into halves. Pile on a hot dish and send quickly to table.

Time: 25 to 30 minutes to bake. Sufficient for about 2 dozen muffins.

CRUMPETS: Proceed exactly the same as directed for Muffins (above),
but stir in only half the quantity of flour used for them, so that
the mixture is more of a batter than a sponge. Cover over, and leave
for 1/2 an hour. At the end of that time take a large wooden spoon
and well beat up the batter, leave in the spoon, cover over, and
leave for another 1/2 an hour. Then give the batter another good beat
up. This process must be repeated 3 times with the intervals. When
completed, see that the hot plate is quite hot, lay out some crumpet
rings rubbed over inside with a little clean lard on a baking tin,
and pour in sufficient of the batter to make the crumpets. When
cooked on one side, turn over with a palette-knife, and when done
take off on to a clean cloth to cool. Muffins and crumpets should
always be served on separate dishes, and both toasted and served as
quickly as possible.

Time: about 20 minutes to cook. Sufficient for about 2 dozen.

My Cinnamon Raisin Bread

breads

      ----MM BY HELEN PEAGRAM----
2 1/2 cup milk
2 oz fresh yeast or
2 tablespoon dried yeast
3 1/2 oz sugar
2 teaspoon cinnamon (or to taste)
2 lb strong plain flour (bread)
1 teaspoon salt
3 1/2 oz margarine or butter
1/2 cup raisins (or to taste)

Place the milk and margarine in a saucepan ( I use microwave) and heat
gently until butter melts. MIx the yeast and sugar together in the
mixing

bowl. Cream the yeast and sugar with a little warm milk. (the milk
should

be at blood heat of 99 F)

Add the remaining liquid at 98.6 F, the flour and the salt and
commence kneading the mixture at speed 2. Cut dough in half and roll
each half out

on lightly floured surface. Sprinkle half of raisins on each rolled
out half and roll up. Place each shaped loaf in pan. Allow to rise
until the dough is double its original size and bake at 375 for 30-35
minutes.

This is a delicious sweet bread and great toasted.  I doubt I will
ever buy raisin bread again.  Too easy to make my own now.

Naan #3

breads, indian

4 cup flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2  egg
1 cup milk
4 tablespoon ghee

In a deep bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda
and salt, and stir with a large spoon or fingers until well mixed.
Make a shallow well in the center, drop in the eggs, and stir them
into the flour mixture. Stirring constantly, pour in the milk in a
slow, thin stream and continue to stir until all the ingredients are
well combined.

Gather the dough into a ball and place it on a smooth, slick surface
such as a jelly roll pan or marble slab. Knead the dough for about 10
minutes, until the dough is smooth and can be gathered into a soft,
somewhat sticky ball. Sprinkle a little flour over and under it from
time to time while kneading to cut down on sticking.

Moisten the hands with a teaspoon of ghee, gather the dough into a
ball, and place it in a bowl, cover with a towel, and let the dough
rest in a warm draft-free place about three hours.

Slide two large ungreased baking sheets into the oven and preheat the
oven and the pans to 450. Divide the dough into six equal portions.

Moistening the hands with ghi occasionally, flatten and form each
portion into a teardrop-shaped leaf, wide at the base and tapered at
the top. Each leaf should be about six inches long and 3-1/2" across
at its widest point, and about 3/8" thick. Arrange the bread leaves
side by side on the preheated baking sheets and bake them in the
middle of the oven for six minutes, or until they are firm to the
touch. Slide the leaves under the broiler for a minute or so to brown
the tops lightly. Serve hot or at room temperature.

Naan 2

breads, indian

1 1/2 cup flour, unbleached
1/2 cup flour, whole wheat
4  egg
1 cup cream, heavy
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1  ghi

Mix flours, eggs, cream, salt, baking powder, and soda to make a soft
dough (like pizza), and knead 10-15 minutes. Add 2 ounces of oil or
melted butter and knead again for 5-8 minutes. Form into a ball,
cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until double in
size. When the dough is ready, a finger pressed in the dough will
make an impression. This will take from 1-2 hours, depending on
temperature and humidity.

Divide the dough into 8-10 balls.  Dipping your fingers into the bowl
of oil or butter, lightly pat each ball to coat with fat. Cover again
with a damp cloth and let rest for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the
oven to 450 degrees.

Wet your palms with oil or butter and pat each ball into a flat
circle, making the circle thinner in the center and a tiny bit
thicker at the edge. Pull one side to make the circle into a teardrop
shape. Each nan should be about the size of your hand.

Place the naan on a cookie sheet and brush the tops with oil or
butter. Bake 10-12 minutes until the nan become puffy. To make them a
perfect golden color, place the baked nan under a broiler for a
minute or two. Serve at once.

Naan Bread

breads, indian

2 oz fresh yeast, or
3 tablespoon yogurt
1 1/2 lb fine whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon wild onion seeds
1  lukewarm water
1  melted butter or ghee

(1) Using the yeast, water and flour, follow the recipe for unleavened
bread below.  Add the seeds. (2) Divide the dough into four equal
parts. (3) Roll each part into a teardrop shape at least 1/4 inch
thick. (4) Preheat the grill to three-quarters heat, cover the rack
pan with foil, and set it in the midway position. (5) Put the naan on
the foil and grill it. Watch it cook (it can easily burn).  As soon
as the first side develops brown patches, remove it from the grill.
(6) Turn it over and brush the uncooked side with a little melted
ghee or butter. (7) Return it to the grill and cook it until it is
sizzling. Remove. (8) Repeat stages 5-8 with the other three naan.
Serve at once. LEAVENED BREAD: (1) Dissolve the fresh yeast in a
little lukewarm water. (2) Put the flour in a *warmed* bowl, make a
well in the center, and pour in the yeast. Yogurt can be used instead
of the yeast by non-vegans. (3) Gently mix into the flour and add
enough water to make a firm dough. (4) Remove from the bowl and knead
on a floured board until well combined.
Return to the bowl and leave in a warm place for a couple of hours to
rise. (5) Knock back the dough by kneading it down to its original
size.

and set aside in a warm place for 3 hours until the dough had risen
to twice its size.

Dust hands with flour.  Knead the dough again for a few mins and
divide into 8 balls.  Roll each ball into a 10-in pancake. Pull each
pancake gently to give it an oval shape. Cover with damp cloth 20
mins.

Heat a griddle until very hot.  Mix the remaining 2 tbs butter/oleo
with poppy seed.  Brush one side of each nan with the mixture and the
other side with warm water.

Place the warm-water side on the griddle for 1/2 minute. Remove from
the griddle and place nan under broiler for about 2 mins. Serve with
curries and tandoori dishes.

Nancy Silverton's Grape Starter

breads

2 cup bread flour
2 1/2 cup water
1/2 lb red grapes, stemmed

The grape starter is from Julia Child's new Master Chef book($17.95
Retail). It is a recipe given by Nancy Silverton. It takes 10 days to
complete but is then yours for life.

Wrap the grapes in well washed cheesecloth, tieing the corners to
form a bag; lightly crush them with a rolling pin (to release the
sugar to mix with the natural yeast on the skins; just like making
wine!) and immerse them in the flour water mix. Cover tightly with a
lid or plastic wrap secured with a rubber band. Leave at room
temperature for 6 days, stirring once or twice a day for the six days.

The bag of grapes will eventually appear inflated, and liquid will
begin to separate from the flour base. The mixture will begin to
taste and smell slightly fruity, and the color will be strange. That
is as it should be. By the sixth day the bag of grapes will have
deflated, the color will be yellow, and the taste pleasantly sour;
the fermentation is complete. The starter is living but weak, and it
needs to be fed.

Remove the grapes and squeeze their juices back into the starter.
Stir it up thouroughly and transfer it to a clean container.
(Although you can use it after just one feeding, the starter will be
stronger and healthier with the full treatment) You can refrigerate
it until you're ready to proceed.

Three days before you plan to use it, stir 1 cup flour and 1 cup
water into the container, blending well. Let stand uncovered at room
temperature until it bubbles up - 3 to 4 hours - then cover and
refrigerate. Repeat this for the second and third day.

Store the starter tightly covered in the refrigerator where it will
keep perfectly for 4 to 6 months.- after which it's a good idea to
pour off all but 2 cups and give it another feeding. Before using the
stored starter for bread, however, give it the full 3-day feeding
schedule once again to restore it and to tone down excess sourness.

This is the starter for the Olive Bread recipe which follows. From:

Nancy Silverton's Overnight Yeast Batter

breads

1 pkg fresh or dried yeast
1/4 cup tap water, in a 1 cup measure
1/4 teaspoon sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup water, droplets more if needed

Crumble or sprinkle the yeast over the water in the measure, whisk in
the sugar, and let rise for several minutes until it begins to foam.
Whisk it again, then scrape into a 2 quart glass or plastic
container. Whisk in the cup of flour, then the water, to make a
mixture the consistency of pancake batter. Set uncovered at room
temperature for several hours, until it foams and produces bit heavy
bubbles. Stir it up, and leave overnight. May be used in place of the
Silverton starter in any of her recipes.

AHEAD OF TIME NOTE: If not to be used the next day, cover and
refrigerate. The batter will gradually turn into a sourdough; feed it
and treat it in the same way as the finished Silverton starter. From:

Native American Hopi Blue Corn Mush "Savory Way"

breads, desserts, ethnic, misc

1 quart water
1 1/2 cup blue cornmeal
1  salt
1  oil for frying

Bring water to a boil in a saucepan, add salt to taste, and whisk in
the cornmeal. Lower the heat and stir the cornmeal for 10 minutes or
until it tastes done.  The coarser the meal, the longer it will take.
Pour the cooked cereal onto a cookie sheet or into a bread pan and
set it aside to cool for an hour or so or until firm. Once it has
cooled, slice it into pieces for frying. Fry the slices in butter or
oil in a nonstick pan until lightly crisped on both sides. If this is
to be eaten as a savory, sprinkle a little red chili or paprika on
top just before serving.

This is cooked like cornmeal mush, molded in a bread pan, and then
sliced and fried. It is delicious with a clear corn flavor and odd
purple-blue color. It's good with eggs and bacon, or with butter.

Navajo Fry Bread

breads

4 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon double-acting baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup water
1 cup vegetable shortening

In a bowl whisk together the flour, the baking powder, and the salt,
stir in the water, and knead the mixture on a floured surface until
it forms a soft but not sticky dough. Let the dough stand, covered
with a kitchen towel, for 15 minutes. Pull off egg-size pieces of the
dough and oat and stretch them into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Poke a
hole witha finger through the center of each round so that the breads
will fry evenly. In a large heavy skillet heat the shortening over
moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking, in it fry the
rounds, 1 at a time, for 2 minutes on each side, or until they are
golden, and transfer the breads as they are fried to paper towels to
drain. Source: Gourmet Magazine

1  vegetable oil; for frying
1  jam, honey, or powdered sugar

In a med. bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt; cut in

Never Fail Sourdough French Bread

breads

1 cup hot water
2 tablespoon honey or sugar
2 tablespoon butter or margarine
1 1/2 cup sourdough starter
4 cup (to 6) flour
1 single cake yeast
2 teaspoon salt(optional)

Mix hot water, honey or sugar, butter or margarine in a large ceramic
mixing bowl. Cool to lukewarm and add yeast, sourdough starter, salt
and flour a cup at a time enough to make a stiff dough. Turn out onto
a floured board and knead for 5 to 8 minutes. Place in an oiled bowl
and cover; let rise until doubled in bulk. Punch down and let rise
for 30 minutes. Turn dough out onto a floured board and let sit ten
minutes. Form into long or round loaf, or into rolls and place in a
well greased pan or cookie sheet and let rise again until doubled.
Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 45 to 55 minutes or until
brown. Makes 1 large loaf or 8 to 12 rolls. SUGGESTIONS: The bread
will rise more quickly if salt is omitted. Use only ceramic or wood
bowls and utensils as metal spoils sourdough.(I use a large
corningware bowl and a plastic whip to mix, then rinse and reuse same
bowl to let kneaded ball rise in). Wash utensils promptly as this
stuff sets up like cement when left to dry!  This recipe will make 4
thin baguette loaves, two small regular loaves or one MONSTER loaf in
a regular bread pan. Grease pans generously with crisco or other
shortening. From The Dough Boys Bakery in San Francisco

New Orleans French Bread

breads, french, cajun

2  envelopes dry yeast
2 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon salt
2 1/2 cup warm water (105 - 115 f)
7 cup bread flour
1  egg white beaten with 1 tsp water (; glaze)

Makes 4 loaves

Sprinkle yeast, sugar and salt over water in large bowl; let stand

abut 10 minutes.

Add 5 cups flour to yeast mixture and stir to incorporate. Stir in
another 1 cup flour.  Turn dough out onto generously floured surface.
Knead in remaining 1 cup flour.  Continue kneading until dough is
very smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.

Butter large bowl.  Add dough, turning to coat entire surface. Cover
and let rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1
hour.

Punch dough down.  Let stand 15 minutes at room temperature.

Generously butter four 18-inch baguette pans.  Knead dough 3 to 4
times. Divide evenly into 4 pieces.  Roll 1 piece into 7x15-inch
oblong. Roll up as for jelly roll. Set seam side down in 1 prepared
pan. Repeat with remaining pieces.  Using razor blade, make three to
four 3/8-inch-deep slashes atop each loaf.  Brush each with glaze.
Let stand in warm draft-free area until dough rises to top of pans,
about 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 450 F.  Bake loaves 15 minutes. Reduce oven
temperature to 350 F.  Continue baking until bread sounds hollow when
tapped on bottom, about 30 minutes. Remove from pans. Serve
immediately. (Can be prepared 3 months ahead.  Cool completely. Wrap
in foil and freeze. Rewarm in 350 F oven for about 20 minutes.)

Night Before French Toast

breads, cheese/eggs, breakfast, diabetic

1/2 teaspoon butter or margarine for baking dish
2 tablespoon butter or margarine - cut into smal; l pieces
1  10 oz. loaf french or italian bread; - cut into 1 slices
8 large eggs
3 cup skim milk
4 teaspoon sugar - or sugar equivalent to 4 ts; . sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

This was posted on *P by Maggie Cecil-Zachos - ID#JSHM25A - and is a
favorite of hers.
Grease a 9 x 13 inch glass baking dish with the 1/2 tsp. butter or
margarine.  Arrange bread in one layer in baking dish.
In a large microwave safe bowl or pan, mix eggs, salt, sugar, milk
and vanilla.  Place the bowl in the microwave and heat on HIGH for
five (5) minutes, stirring twice.
For heating on the range, place the egg mixture in a medium
saucepan and heat on medium, stirring as needed, until hot, BUT NOT
BOILING, about 5 minutes. Be careful not to let the mixture boil,
because it will set the eggs.
Pour the hot egg mixture gently over the bread slices and cover with
plastic wrap.  Refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.....
To bake - dot with the 2 tbsp. butter pieces and place uncovered
pan in cold oven.  Bake at 350 degrees for 45 to 50 minutes, until
bread is puffy and lightly brown. Remove from heat and let stand 5
minutes.
Serve with Cary's SF Syrup, sugar free jelly, or fresh fruit.

No-Fail Bagels

breads

2  packets active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (105-115f)
2 teaspoon sugar
2 cup lukewarm water
2 1/2 teaspoon salt
6 cup bread flour
1/2 cup yellow cornmeal

Place yeast in glass with 1/2 cup warm water.  Stir in sugar until
yeast is disolved.  Let stand for 5 minutes, until foamy on top. Pour
this mixture into a bowl and add 2 cups lukewarm water. Stir in salt.
Add the 5 1/2 cups flour a cup at a time, mixing with a wooden spoon
to blend after each addition.  Dough will be sticky.

Spread 1/4 cup of the remaining flour on a work surface. Place dough
on flour.  Place 1/4 cup flour on top of the dough.

Begin kneading slowly until the flour  comes together with the rest
of the dough.  Knead vigorously for 15 minutes. You may have to add
several tablespoons of flour if the mixture is sticky.

Use a sharp knife dipped in flour cut the dough into 16 equal
portions. Roll each portion into a ball. Poke your thumbs through the
center to make a hole about the size of a quarter.

Spread 1/4 cup cornmeal on each of two trays or cutting boards and
place 8 formed bagels on each about 1 inch apart. Cover with a clean
dish towel and place in a warm draft free spot for 45 minutes to rise.

Remove towel and place trays of bagels in the refrigerator for 1 hour.

Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees. Boil 3 cups water in a large pot.
Spread 1/4 cup yellow cornmeal on 2 cookie sheets.

Place bagels four at a time into the boiling water. The perfect bagel
should sink to the bottom and rise immediatly. Boil about 4 minutes
turning about every 30 seconds. Don't worry if your bagels don't sink
to the bottom; however if they sink to the bottom and lie there, wait
until they flost to the top before timing the 4 minutes.

Remove bagels with a slotted spoon and place on a clean towel for a
few seconds to drain excess water. Place 8 bagels on each cookie
sheet.

You can now add a favorite topping sesame, garlic or onion if
desired. Bake 35 minutes or until golden. Remove bagels from cookie
sheet and let them cool on a wire rack. From: Gary Fricke

No-Knead Bread

breads, low fat

7 1/2 cup whole-wheat flour
2 tablespoon active dry yeast
1 tablespoon molasses; unsulphered
4 cup water; warm

Recipe by: McDougall Plan Put flour in a large bowl. Place in a warm
oven for 30 minutes to warm flour and bowl to 110 degrees (1 1/2
minutes in microwave). Dissolve yeast in 1 cup warm water (110
degrees). Add molasses and mix well. Let rest about 3 minutes. Then,
add the yeast mixture and the remaining water (3 cups, warm). Mix
well by stirring or use one hand to mix in bowl. Do no Knead. Dough
will be sticky. Use non-stick pans or lightly oil two large loaf pan
(9"x5"x3"). Sprinkle with cornmeal. Spoon dough mixture into pans.
Smooth top with hand dampened with water to prevent sticking. Cover
with towel. Place in a warm spot. Let rise about 1 hour or until
dough reaches top of pans. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bake for 20
minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees. Bake 30-40 minutes longer.
Remove pans from oven, tip pans on sides, and let cool on racks for
15 minutes. Remove loaves from pans and continue to cool before
storing. Bread is moist, so keep best in refrigerator.

HELPFUL HINTS: Recipe may be doubled to make four loaves. Refrigerate
or freeze extra loaves until ready to use. Other flours may be used
in place of 1.5 cups whole wheat, such as brown rice flour, garbanzo
flour, or barley flour. Use of nonstick pans is recommended. From the

Non

breads, russian

2 1/2 cup ; water, lukewarm
1 pkg yeast, dry
1 1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon oil
3/4 teaspoon salt
4 cup flour, unbleached
2 cup flour, whole wheat
1/2 cup onion; minced
1 teaspoon garlic; minced

Approx. Cook Time: 3:00 In a
large bowl, combine 1/2 cup of the water, the yeast, and sugar and
let stand until foamy; about 5 minutes. Add the rest of the water,
the oil, and the salt, then gradually add four cups of the unbleached
flour and all of the whole wheat flour, one cup at a time, mixing
well after each addition with a wooden spoon. Transfer the dough to a
floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes,
adding enough of the remaining unbleached flour to prevent sticking.
Shape the dough into a ball, place in a buttered bowl and turn to
coat. Cover with a tea towel and let rise in a warm, draft- free
place until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Divide the dough into
eight pieces and shape each piece into a ball. On a floured surface
with a floured rolling pin, roll out each ball into a round about
seven inches in diameter. With a pastry brush, brush each round with
cold water. Cover with a towel and let stand 30 minutes. Meanwhile,
preheat the oven to 500 F. (yes, five hundred). Place a heavy-duty
baking sheet in the oven to heat for 15 minutes. Wet your hands in
cold water and make an indentation in the center of each dough round
about two inches in diameter. With a fork, prick all over the
indentation in a circular fashion. Sprinkle with the onion and
garlic. Carefully remove the baking sheet from the oven. Sprinkle the
rounds lightly with cold water and place on the baking sheet. Bake in
the lowest part of the oven until the breads are light golden and
baked through, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, wrap in a
clean, damp kitchen towel, and let rest for 10 minutes.

Non / Flat Onion Breads (Central Asia)

breads, dumplings

6 tablespoon butter
1 1/2 cup onions -- finely chopped
3/4 cup water -- lukewarm
1 teaspoon salt
3 cup all-purpose flour

Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a heavy 10 to 12 inch skillet set
over high heat.  Add the onions, reduce the heat to low and, stirring
occasionally, cook 3 to 5 minutes, or until the onions are soft but
not brown.  Transfer them to a bowl and cool to room temperature.

Melt the remaining butter in the skillet and pour it into a large
bowl. Add the lukewarm (110 - 115 F) water and, with a large spoon,
stir in the chopped onions, salt and 2 1/2 cups of flour, 1/2 cup at
a time. If necessary, beat in as much of the remaining 1/2 cup of the
flour as you need to make a dough that does not stick to your
fingers. Gather the dough into a large, compact ball and divide it
into 16 pieces. With the palms of your hands, shape each piece of
dough into a 1 1/2 to 2 inch ball. Then, with a lightly floured
rolling pin, roll out the balls one at a time into circles that are
about 8 inches in diameter. Set the rounds of dough aside.

Set a heavy 10- to 12-inch ungreased pan over high heat. When it is
hot enough for a drop of water flicked across its surface to instantly
evaporate, place one round of dough in the center. Brown for 3 or 4
minutes on each side, turning it over with your fingers or a wide
spatula; do not be concerned if the bread does not brown evenly.

Transfer the bread to a rack to dry and proceed to fry and dry the
remaining dough similarly.  Serve the bread in a basket or other
porous container.  If for any reason the bread becomes limp after a
day or so, place the rounds in a single layer on a cookie sheet and
bake them for 5 to 10 minutes in a preheated 250F oven until they
freshen.

1/4 cup water
1  egg; beaten

Mix all dry ingredients together.  Then add egg, buttermilk, and
water. Drop by spoonful into hot deep fat. Fry to a golden brown. (If
a deep pot is used, the hushpuppy will float to the top when done).
*NOTE: If you don't want to buy buttermilk, substitute 1/2 c. milk
with 1 T. lemon juice added. Stir and let it sit for 5 minutes. It
works just as well.  Please note: You can make variations of this
recipe in several ways: i.e., 1/4 c. finely chopped onion, less

      ----FILLING----
3 oz boneless breast of chicken  skinned; , diced
1/2 teaspoon cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon cooking sherry
1/4 lb chinese sausage; diced
1 tablespoon chinese dried shrimp; minced
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
3 oz chinese barbecued pork  diced
1 bunch green onions; minced
1 teaspoon oyster sauce (optional)
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1/4 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt

MEASURE FLOUR into a large mixing bowl; add boiling water, stirring
quickly with chopsticks or fork, then add cold water and mix well.
Work dough until smooth and supple. Roll dough into shape of a ball.
Cover well with plastic wrap or damp cloth; set aside to rest for 1
hour at room temperature. Place the chicken in a small bowl; add
cornstarch, cooking sherry and pinch of salt. Set aside and
refrigerate and let marinate until ready to use. Stir-fry Chinese
sausage and dried shrimp in hot vegetable oil in a small frying pan
over high heat for 1 minute. Add chicken with its marinade and
stir-fry for another 2 minutes. Quickly stir in barbecued pork and
3/4 cup of the minced onions. (Set aside remaining onions for pancake
wrappers.) Immediately season with the oyster sauce, soy sauce, sugar
and salt, and mix well. Turn off heat; divide into 16 portions and
set aside. Knead dough until smooth and divide equally into 16
pieces; cover with plastic wrap. Work 1 piece of dough at a time,
keeping the rest covered in plastic wrap. Take a piece of dough and
rub both sides with a bit of shortening, then roll out with a rolling
pin to 6 inches in diameter. Again rub shortening (about 1 teaspoon)
onto 1 side of the dough; sprinkle evenly with about 1 teaspoon
minced scallions and a pinch of salt. Curl up the dough from 1 end
into a long, narrow cylinder; then curl up again lengthwise into a
snail-like cylinder. Place the dough on its broad side and roll out

Norwegian Lefser

breads, norwegian

1 1/2 cup :boiling water
2 tablespoon butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup rye flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour

There are many different types of this flat bread. This version should
remain soft rather than crisp (hence the name lefser, or soft cake).
PREHEAT OVEN TO 450F. In a large bowl, combine water, butter, salt,
rye flour and all-purpose flour and beat well. Stir in whole wheat
flour and beat until you have a smooth dough that resembles dough for
a baking powder biscuit. Divide dough into 4 parts. Cut each portion
into quarters. Flour a board and roll each piece of dough to make a
thin 10- to 12-inch circle. If desired, use lefser rolling pin to
make a pattern on the dough. Place 2 or 3 dough circles on ungreased
baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven 3 to 5 minutes--NOT until
completely browned. Cool on a rack. Wrap airtight.

1 teaspoon salt
2 cup boiling water
2 tablespoon shortening
1/2 teaspoon baking powder

Mix cornmeals and salt thoroughly and pour in 2 cups boiling water
containing 2 Tablespoons shortening.  This should produce a firm

1/2 teaspoon baking powder dissolved in 2 Tablespoons water.  Pinch
off dough and pat into small round cakes.  Fry immediately or
refrigerate on waxed paper for later cooking.  Fry in deep fat hot

Oakcakes

breads

1 pint mixed milk and water
1 oz yeast
6 oz fine oatmeal
3 oz plain flour
1 teaspoon salt (or slightly less)

Mix the flour, salt and oatmeal. Warm the liquid and stir in
gradually to make a smooth batter. Crumble in the yeast, stir gently
and leave to stand in a warm place for 20 mins. Stir again and cook
in a stong, well greased frying pan. Pour in enough batter to cover
the base fairly thinly and trun out when cooked.

Remarks: This recipe is heavily adapted, but works. Traditionally the
oat cakes were cooked on a `backstone' - a stone or iron sheet, over
an open fire. It is still possible in some places in Yorkshire to buy
a `girdle', a cast iron sheet, about 12 in diameter, with a hoop
handle - these are ideal. When cooked, the oatcakes where hung on
plain wooden rack suspended from the ceiling, known as bread fleaks.
The oatcakes were eaten either fresh or dried.

They can be fried with bacon, or suttered and eaten alone with cheese,
treacle, golden syrup etc.

Oatcakes (Bakestone Recipes)

breads, breakfast

4 oz medium oatmeal*
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pinch bicarbonate of soda
2 tablespoon melted bacon fat**
2 fl oz hot water***

*Grinding down regular rolled oats slightly in a blender or grinder
will be a help.  **Or beef dripping. ***Approximately. -- Mix the
oatmeal, salt and soda in a bowl.  Make a well in the center.  Pour
in the melted fat and add enough water to make a stiff dough which
can be squeezed into a ball. Sprinkle the board and your hands with
oatmeal and knead the mixture until there are no cracks in it.
Flatten the ball and roll it out into a round just under 1/4 inch
thick. Invert a plate on top and trim off the ragged edges -- these
can be added to the next batch of dough to be rolled. Cut the round
into quarters, lift them onto a warmed and greased bakestone and cook
over moderate heat for 20 minutes or until the triangles curl at the
corners.  Turn and cook the other side for 5 minutes, or finish under
a moderate grill.  Store the oatcakes in an airtight tin, and toast
under a moderate grill, or in the oven, before serving.  -- These are
served with honey, marmalade or jam for breakfast, or with crowdie (a
slightly sweet Highland Scots cottage cheese) for tea. They are
especially good with fried herring or smoked haddock.  Not to mention
any kind of caviar you can get your hands on.

Oatcakes (Traditional Method)

breads

4 oz oatmeal
1 teaspoon fat
1  ; water, hot
1 pinch salt
1 pinch baking soda

As the dough stiffens when lying about, it is best to make a bannock
at a time, using the above quantities, the next being prepared whilst
the one is on the girdle [not a typo!].

Put the oatmeal into a bowl and add the salt and soda. Melt a
teaspoon of dripping or fat (bacon fat, goose fat, or poultry fat are
all excellent). Make a well in the centre of the meal, put in the
dripping, and add as much hot water as will make a stiff paste.  Rub
plenty of oatmeal on to the baking board; turn out the mixture and
form into a smooth ball. Knead and roll out as thinly as possible.
Rub constantly on both sides with dry meal to prevent sticking, and
keep the edges as even as possible by pinching wit finger and thumb.
Give a final rub with meal, cut into a round, using a plate, and then
cut the bannock into farls (fardels or quarters) or into smaller
pieces. Place on a moderately hot girdle and bake steadily till th
cakes curl up at the edge; then toast the other side slightly before
a clea fire or finish in the oven.

If you have neither a girdle nor a thick-bottomed frying-pan, you may
bake the oatcakes in a moderate over for 20-30 minutes, till quite
dry and curle at the edges.

Buttered oatcakes are particularly good with marmalade, honey,
cheese, frie herrings, and sardines.

1 1/2 cup rolled oats (oatmeal)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
6 tablespoon (3/4 stick) butter or margarine, me; lted and cooled
1/2 cup milk

a few with a glass of fresh lemonade.

325~ F      20 to 25 minutes

Stir together the flour, oats, salt, and sugar in a large bowl or in
the food processor. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles
coarse meal. Blend in enough of the milk to form a dough that will
hold together in a cohesive ball.

Divid the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll as thin as possible, to about 1/16 inch
thick. Using a spatula, rolling pin, or your hands, transfer the
rolled dough gently onto a large baking sheet.

With a sharp knife, score the dough into 2-inch squares without
cutting all the way throug the dough. Prick each square 2 or 3 times
with the tines of a fork.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, turning over after 15 minutes, until
crisp. Cool on a rack. Break into individual crackers when cool.

Oatmeal Cinnamon Scones

breads

1/4 cup oatmeal
1 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cup flour
6 tablespoon butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup buttermilk or:
1/2 cup cream or:
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup brown sugar, packed
1 large egg, beaten
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder (dbl acting)
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon grated orange zest

Position rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees.
Into a large bowl, sift the flour, sugars, baking powder, baking
soda, and salt. Add oatmeal & mix together. Distribute the butter
cubes over the flour mixture. Using your fingertips, quickly rub the
butter cutes into the flour mixture, until the mixture resembles
coarse meal.

In a medium bowl, stir together the buttermilk, egg, vanilla, & zest.

Add the liquid mixture to the flour mixture. With a large rubber
spatula, using as few strokes as possible, stir gently until the
dough is moistened and begins to cling together. Handling the dough
as little as possible, stir until all the ingredients are completely
combined.

Using a 1/3-c. measuring cup, drop the dough onto an ungreased baking
sheet, leaving at least 1-inch between the scones. Bake 16 to 18
minutes, until the scones are golden brown. Cool the scones on the
baking sheet set on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Using a mental
spatula, transfer the scones to the wire rack and cool completely.
Serve warm or store completely cooled scones in an airtight container
at room temperature.

Oatmeal Cinnamon Swirl Bread

breads

1 1/2 cup warm skim milk
1 cup oats
1  white flour
2/3 cup brown sugar
1  egg white
1 teaspoon salt
1 pkg yeast
      ----FILLING----
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon cinnamon
1 tablespoon vanilla

Stir the warm milk and oatmeal together and let it sit for about 15
min. Stir in the yeast till dissolved and let this sit for another 15
min. Beat the egg while a bit first to break it up and stir it in,
too. Also add the sugar and salt.  Beat this very well for about 5
min. Now start to add unbleached white flour (I use 'bread' flour,
but it isn't strickly neccessary). Beat in as much as you can by
hand, then turn the dough our onto a flour-dusted counter and knead,
addd flour as neccessary. Be careful not to add too much, or the
bread will be dry. This is a sticky dough and a dough-scaper or
spatula will be helpful in scaping it off the counter while kneading.
Knead for more than 5 min. Dump the dough back into the bowl (no need
to wash it or 'grease' it!) and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let
the dough rise till double (the time will depend on whether you use
regular or fast rising yeast- should be about 1 h for regular and
30min for fast rising).

Scrape the dough out onto the counter again and give it a few kneads.
Flour the counter will and shape the dough into a regular shaped
rectangle and use a floured rolling pin the roll it out. Roll the
short side to match your loaf pan width and roll it as 'long' as you
want. Spread the sugar and cinnamon over the drizzle the vanilla over
it all. Roll it up and make sure there is no sugar over the last inch
or so, so the dough seals. Strech dough over the open ends, so the
sugar doesn't leak out and place the dough in a 'pam' sprayed large
loaf pan (9X5?). Cover it with plastic wrap that has been sprayed
with 'pam' and let it rise till just over the top of the pan.  Bake
in a 350 F oven for about 35-40 min.

Oatmeal Honey Bread

breads

2 cup oatmeal, uncooked (e.g., quaker's o; ld fashioned oatmeal)
2/3 cup honey
2 tablespoon salt
3 tablespoon butter (or margarine)
1 cup water, boiling
2 pkg yeast (dry), active
1 cup water, lukewarm
2/3 cup milk
5 cup flour, unbleached (up to 6 c; may substitute up to 2 c
1  oil

Put the oatmeal, honey, salt and butter in a large mixing bowl.  Add
boiling water and mix together. Let stand for 45 minutes, stirring
occasionally.

Following the yeast package directions, add the yeast to lukewarm water,
and let it soften for about 5 minutes. Add the yeast mixture to the oats
and honey mixture. Mix in the milk and stir well.

Stir in the flour, 1/2 cup at a time.  When the dough is too stiff to stir,
pour it out onto a well-floured surface and knead it firmly, adding a
little flour if necessary. Knead it until the dough is smooth and elastic
(about 6-8 minutes). Form the dough into a ball. Place the dough into a
large greased bowl, coating the entire ball of dough.

Cover with a damp cloth and place in a warm, cozy, humid place.  (I put it
in a cool oven, with a small saucepan of hot tap water sitting on the
bottom of the oven.) Let rise for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the dough has
doubled in bulk.

Punch down the dough and split in half.  Spread the dough into two greased
loaf pans, coating the dough as before, and cover with a damp cloth, and
let rise for about an hour in a warm, cozy, humid place.

Bake at 350 F for 35-40 minutes, or until loaves sound hollow when tapped.
Cool on a bread rack for about ten minutes.

NOTES:

*  A yeast bread for people who like oatmeal.  Yield:  makes 2 loaves.

*  Kneading is difficult to describe in words, but many cookbooks have
pictures.  The idea is to exercise the dough and work some more flour into
it. Bread freezes very well; give it an hour or so to thaw, then heat it up
at 350 degrees F. for about ten minutes.

*  Instant and quick-cooking oatmeal is not satisfactory in this recipe.
Besides the ubiquitous Quaker oats, you can use any commercial rolled oats
or steel-cut oats. If you use the steel-cut oats, then soak for 1 hour in
step 1.

: Difficulty:  easy if you already know how to knead dough, moderate
otherwise.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 4 1/2 hours waiting time.
: Precision:  All amounts (including times) are approximate.

Oatmeal-Rye Bread

breads

1 pkg active dry yeast
2 1/2 cup warm water (110'f.)
1 tablespoon sugar
2 cup rye flour
5 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup regular rolled oats
1/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1  butter or margarine (opt)

Omar Khayyam, whose paradise required only a book of verses, a loaf of
bread, and a jug of wine, might have suffered seriously from
malnutrition (along with the mysterious Thou, who sang beside him) if
the loaf were the bubble bread we are all familiar with. Although
this flabby loaf contains niacin, thiamin, riboflavin, and a rich
assortment of mono- and diglycerides (ethoxylated and otherwise), it
is not especially rich in protien and fiber, two pillars of
contemporary sound diet.

1. The night before, sprinkle yeast over warm water in a large (at
least 4-quart) bowl and let stand for 5 minutes to soften. Then add
granulated sugar and rye flour; beat to blend well. Cover bowl
tightly with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature up to a
day (at least 12 hours). Stir in 5 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, rolled
oats, brown sugar, and salt.
2. TO KNEAD BY HAND, scrape dough onto a board lightly coated with
all-purpose flour. Knead, adding flour as required to prevent
sticking, until dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Place
dough in a greased bowl, turn over to grease top, and cover with
plastic wrap.
3. TO KNEAD WITH A DOUGH HOOK, beat until dough pulls cleanly from
bowl. If dough still feels sticky, beat in flour, 1 tablespoon at a
time; remove dough hook and cover bowl with plastic wrap.
4. Let dough rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch
down and divide into 3 equal portions. Shape each portion into a loaf
and set in a greasd 4x8" loaf pan. Cover loaves lightly and let rise
in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. With a sharp
knife or razor blade, slash top of each loaf in about 3 places,
making cuts about 1/8" deep. Brush tops lightly with water.
5. Bake in a 350'F. oven; after 10 minutes, brush tops lightly with
more water. Continue baking until loaves are well browned, about 40
minutes total. For a shiny finish, rub tops of hot loaves with soft
butter. Invert onto racks. Serve warm or cool. If loaves are made
ahead, cool and package airtight up to a day; freeze to store longer.
Make 3 loaves, each about 1
1/2    pounds.

Old Country Sourdough Rye Bread

breads

2 teaspoon dry yeast
1/3 cup lukewarm water
1 teaspoon honey
1 cup lukewarm water
3 tablespoon molasses
1 tablespoon oil
1/2 cup mashed potatoes
1 cup *onion starter
1 tablespoon caraway seed
1 tablespoon salt
2 1/2 cup whole-wheat flour
1/2 cup wheat germ
1 1/2 cup rye flour
2 tablespoon corn meal
1  egg, beaten
1 teaspoon caraway seeds

Sprinkle yeast over 1/3 cup lukewarm water.  Add 1 tsp. honey. Let
dissolve for five minutes. In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup
lukewarm water, molasses, oil, mashed potatoes and mix until smooth.
Add yeast mixture, onion starter, caraway seeds and salt.  Mix until
well-blended. Add whole-wheat flour, (reserving 1/2 cup for
kneading), and wheat germ, mix well for about 5 minutes. Let dough
rest for 10 minutes. Add rye flour. Knead on a board for about 10
minutes, using 1/2 cup whole-wheat flour, until dough is elastic, and
"springy." Place dough in an oiled bowl, turning it over to coat
surface with oil. Cover, set bowl in hot water and leave to rise in a
warm place for 1 1/2 hours until doubled in bulk. Stir down dough and
divide into two loaves. These can be shaped in rounds and placed on
an oiled cookie sheet which has been sprinkled with corn meal, or
they can be placed in oiled loaf pans. Glaze tops with beaten egg and
sprinkle with caraway seeds. Set to rise in an unheated oven for
approximately one hour.  Turn oven to 400 for 20 minutes, then turn
it down to 375 and bake for 30 minutes longer or until bread tests
done. (For a crustier load, put a pan of hot water on oven floor
during the first 20 minutes when oven is at 400.) Cool on rack before
serving.

*To make onion starter, add 1 small, peeled onion--loosely wrapped in
cheesecloth, to fresh batch of basic sourdough starter mixture and
leave to sour at room temperature for at least three days. Before
making old country rye bread, add a second cup of water and a second
cup of flour to the onion starter, leaving it at room temperature
overnight. 2 loaves.

Old Fashioned Cinnamon Raisin Braid

breads

1/3 cup instant mashed potato flakes
1/3 cup boiling water
1/4  to 1/2 cup warm water
4 tablespoon sugar
1 pkg active dry yeast
3 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup instant nonfat dry milk
1/4 cup cold butter or margarine, cut into; 4 pieces
1/2 cup dark raisins
1 teaspoon salt
1  egg
1  cinnamon sugar

Makes 1 loaf

Stir potato flakes into boiling water.  Cool until lukewarm. Reserve.

Combine 1/4 cup of the warm water, 1 tablespoon of the sugar and
yeast. Stir to dissolve yeast and let stand until bubbly, about 5
minutes.

Fit processor with steel blade.  Measure flour, dry milk, butter,
remaining 3 tablespoons of the sugar and salt into work bowl. Process
until mixed, about 15 seconds.

Add potato mixture to flour mixture.  Process until mixed, about 5
seconds.

Add yeast mixture and egg to flour mixture.  Turn on processor and
very slowly drizzle just enough remaining water through feed tube
into flour mixture so dough forms a ball that cleans the sides of the
bowl. Process until ball turns around bowl about 25 times. Turn off
processor and let dough stand 1 to 2 minutes.

Turn on processor and gradually drizzle in enough remaining water to
make dough soft, smooth and satiny but not sticky. Process until
dough turns around bowl about 15 times.

Turn dough onto lightly floured surface and knead 1/2 cup dark
raisins into the dough..  Shape into ball and place in lightly
greased bowl, turning to grease all sides. Cover loosely with plastic
wrap and let stand in warm place until  doubled, about 1 hour.

Punch down dough.  Prepare Cinnamon Sugar.  Divide dough into 3 equal
parts.  Shape each part into strand 20 inches long. Roll each strand
in Cinnamon Sugar. Braid strands together and place in greased
9x5x3-inch loaf pan.  Tuck ends under and pinch to seal. Let stand in
warm place until almost doubled, about 45 minutes.

Heat oven to 350 F.  Bake until evenly brown and loaf sounds hollow
when tapped, 35 - 40 minutes.

Remove immediately from pan.  Cool on wire rack.

CINNAMON SUGAR: 1/4 cup sugar 2 tsp ground cinnamon 1 Tbsp butter or
margarine, at room temperature

Old Fashioned Shortcake

breads

1 quart fruit (strawberries)
1/3 cup sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 1/2 cup heavy cream
1  buttermilk biscuit dough
2 tablespoon buttermilk
2 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon soft butter
      ----BUTTERMILK BISCUIT DOUGH----
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cake flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup cold unsalted butter
3/4 cup buttermilk or heavy cream
1  (or more)

Preheat the oven to 450F; set rack in middle level. Prepare biscuit
dough. For a large shortcake, pat the dough into a 9-inch disk on a
parchment-lined cookie sheet. For individual shortcakes, pat dough
into a 6-by-12- inch rectangle and cut into eight 3-inch biscuits
with a sharp, floured knife. Transfer to a parchment-lined cookie
sheet. Paint tops with buttermilk. Sprinkle with sugar. Bake for 10
to 15 minutes, until well risen and golden. Check the center of the
large shortcake with a toothpick to make sure it is baked through: If
the pick emerges with dough still clinging to it, lower temperature
to 350F and bake another 5 minutes. Slide the large shortcake onto a
platter immediately after it is baked. Use a sharp, serrated knife to
slice through the middle, making two layers. Slide the edge of a
cookie sheet between the two layers and lift the top layer off.
Butter the bottom layer and pour all but 1/2 cup of the sweetened
fruit on. Slide the top back on and pour the remaining berries over
the top. Split the small shortcakes in the same way and place the
bottoms on individual dessert plates. Butter them and top with about
1/3 cup of the fruit mixture. Replace tops and pour a tablespoon or
so of the remaining berries over the top. Serve immediately. Pass the
cream in a bowl for the guests to help themselves. BUTTERMILK BISCUIT
DOUGH: COMBINE THE FLOURS, salt and baking powder in a mixing bowl
and stir well to mix. Rub in the butter by hand or with a pastry
blender until the mixture is mealy. Stir in 3/4 cup of the buttermilk
with a fork and continue stirring gently until the dough begins to
hold together. (If the dough is dry, add more buttermilk, 1
tablespoon at a time.) Sprinkle the work surface generously with
flour and scrape the dough onto it. Fold the dough over on itself two
or three times. Use the dough immediately for shortcakes, following
the instructions above. Use this recipe to make a large shortcake or
eight small ones. This same dough is used as the topping in cobbler
recipes.

Old Stone Inn Corn Fritters

breads, southern, corn, fritter

6 each ears tender fresh corn
3 each eggs; separated
7/8 cup sifted all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
1  cayenne pepper to taste
2 teaspoon baking powder
1  oil for deep frying

(1) Cut the corn from the cobs, and scrape the cobs well to extract
the milk. You should have 1-1/2 to 2 cups of corn. Mash 1/4 cup of
the corn pulp with a potato masher or in a blender or processor.
(This helps to distribute the corn flavor and extract some starch.)
Return it to the rest of the corn.

(2) Mix the egg yolks with the corn. Sift together the flour, salt,
sugar, cayenne, and baking powder. Add to the corn and mix well.

(3) Beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry and grainy, and fold
them into the corn mixture.

(4) Heat fresh oil in a deep-fat fryer to about 375 degrees F. Drop
the batter by tablespoonfuls into the fat, and cook the fritters
until browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Turn, and when both sides
are golden brown, remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper
towels. Serve at once.

Old Time Sourdough

breads

      ----STARTER----
2 cup water
2 cup flour
1 pkg yeast
      ----SOURDOUGH BREAD----
4 cup flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon grease

Starter:

Combine the three ingredients and let sit over night in a warm place.

Use of Starter:  Each time you use the starter, pour off 1/2 cup or
more to use in you next baking effort.  Do not keep starter in a
metal container. A glass or potter container works best.  The starter
will usually keep for several months in the refrigerator but frequent
use will renew the starter and keep it fresh.  Never add anything to
your starter except plain flour and warm water.  Set starter the
night before use by adding flour and water (2 cups each).  Remove
your fresh cup of starter and use the bubbly batter in the bread
recipe.

Bread:

Sift the dry ingredients into a bowl.  Pour in sponge and mix (also
grease).  Knead the dough for ten minutes, then allow to rise for
three to four hours.  Disolve 1/4 teaspoon baking soda in 1 Tb. water
then knead into dough.  Allow to rise again.  Shape into loaves and
bake at 375 degress F. for 45 minutes.

Old-Fashioned Chewy Double Ginger Cookies

biscuits

1/2 cup shortening
1 cup sugar
2 large eggs
1 cup molasses
3 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon ground ginger
1 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup fine-chopped crystallized ginger
1  sugar

In large bowl, cream together shortening and one cup sugar until
light and fluffy.  Beat in eggs one at a time; beat in molasses.

Stir together flour, ground ginger, baking soda, cloves and cinnamon;
stir into creamed mixture in three parts. Mix in crystallized ginger
until smooth.

Remove dough from bowl and wrap in floured wax paper; refrigerate
overnight.  (Dough will be quite soft.)

With lightly floured hands, form dough into 1" (2.5 cm) balls; gently
roll in sugar.  Place about 2" (5 cm) apart on greased baking sheets.

Bake at 350F (180C) for 10 - 12 minutes or just until set. Remove to
wire racks to cool.

Makes about 6 dozen. I'm not much of a cookie baker because it seems
so much effort for something that is gobbled down so quickly, but
these are worth the trouble (I always set some aside for myself, just
to be sure I'll get some). Guten Apetit!

Olive & Rosemary Flat Bread

breads

1  stephen ceideburg
1/2 cup brown rice flour (see note)
1 1/2 teaspoon granular yeast
2 teaspoon sugar
1 1/4 cup warm water (110 degrees f.)
4 large egg whites, at room temperature
1 tablespoon olive oil
12  oil-cured black olives, pitted and; roughly chopped
4 teaspoon dried rosemary, or to taste
1  egg yolk mixed with 1/2 teaspoon wa; ter
1 large garlic clove, peeled, cut in 3 piec; es
1/2 cup corn flour (see note)
1/2 cup cornstarch
2 teaspoon xanthan gum powder
1  to 1 1/2 teaspoons salt

Stir together 1/2 cup of the rice flour, the yeast, sugar and 1/2 cup
of the warm water in a 2-cup glass measure. Let rest in a warm place
until doubled in volume, about 10 minutes.

Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and draw two 8 inch
circles on it (use a cake pan as a guide).

Beat egg whites lightly, add olive oil, chopped olives and 2
teaspoons of the rosemary; set aside.

Combine garlic and egg yolk; set aside. (Garlic will perfume the
glaze but won't burn in the oven, as chopped garlic would.)

Combine remaining 1 cup rice flour, the corn flour, corn- starch,
xanthan gum powder and salt in bowl.

Add remaining 3/4 cup warm water to egg white-olive mixture a stir
into flour. Stir in yeast mixture and beat until smooth.

Using a rubber spatula, spread soft dough into 8-inch circles marked
on the parchment paper heaping it up slightly in the middle. Cover
loaves with lightly greased plastic wrap and let rise until doubled
in bulk, about 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

Discard garlic and brush egg glaze over loaves. Sprinkle tops with
remaining 2 teaspoons rosemary. Using a razor blade, slash tops of
loaves into a large diamond grid pattern. (Use an up-and-down cutting
motion rather than dragging the blade through the soft dough.)

Bake for 20 minutes, until well browned.

Makes two 8-inch diameter, 11-ounce loaves.

Note: Brown rice flour and corn flour may be found in some health food
stores and Rainbow Groceries.

Olive & Thyme Bread

breads

1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 1/2 cup water -- 105-115 degrees
1 1/4 cup basic bread sponge
3 1/4 cup all-purpose flour --
1  unbleached
1/3 cup all-purpose flour -- for
1  kneading
4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 cup kalamata olives -- pit &
1  chop roughly
4 teaspoon fresh thyme -- coarsely
1  chopped

Can use any fleshy black olive in place of Kalamatas.

In a bowl, dissolve  the yeast in the water.  Allow to proof for three
minutes.

Stir the sponge into the water, breaking the sponge up using your
hands or a spoon.

Add 3 1/4 cups of the flour and salt and mix, scraping and folding
until the dough gathers into a single mass. Mix in the olives and
thyme until distributed. This dough will be wet and sticky.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead as much
of the 1/3 cup of flour as is required to make a smooth and elastic
dough.

Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and
refrigerate overnight.

Halve the dough and shape each piece into a ball and place in an
oiled bowl and cover with plastic.  Allow to rise in a draft-free
location for two hours.

Turn out each piece of the dough onto a lightly floured work surface
and press out any large bubbles. Shape each half into a loose oval.
Transfer each of the ovals into a 9x5 loaf pan, with the seam on the
bottom. Cover again with plastic and allow to double in bulk, which
should take 2 to 2
1/2    hours.

Preheat the oven for at least thirty minutes along with a baking
stone or tiles on the middle rack to 425. Place a baking pan with
decent sides on the bottom shelf. Boil two cups of water. Place the
loaf pans on the stones and then immediately pour the boiling water
into the baking pan.

Bake for 35-40 minutes until the loaves are hollow sounding when
removed from the pans and tapped on the bottom. Take the loaves out
of the pans and cool on a rack.

Olive Bread With Mint & Onions

breads

1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 1/2 cup warm water
1/2 cup whole wheat flour, preferably coars; ely ground
3  to 3 1/2 cups white flour, preferab; ly unbleached
3 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 small onion, chopped
2 teaspoon dried mint
12  black greek olives, pitted and halv; ed
1  corn meal

Makes 1 large round loaf

Make a sponge by dissolving the yeast and sugar in the warm water and
stirring in the whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups of the white flour.
Beat at least 50 strokes, then cover with plastic wrap and let stand
anywhere from 1 to 6 hours.

Stir all but a teaspoon of the olive oil into the dough, as well as
the salt, the chopped onion, dried mint, and olives. Then work in
remaining white flour until it becomes hard to stir.

Turn the dough out onto a floured working surface and let rest while
you clean out the bowl.  Knead dough for about 8 to 10 minutes,
adding more flour as necessary, until the dough is resilient. Lightly
oil the bowl, return the dough to it, turning to coat, and cover with
plastic wrap. Let rise until double in volume - about 1 1/2 hours.

Turn the dough out, punch it down, and form into a large round loaf.
Place on a baking sheet sprinkled with corn meal. Cover loosely with
a towel and let rise again until double - about 45 minutes. (Or let
raise and bake in La Cloche.)

If you have baking tiles in your oven, be sure they are good and hot
by preheating the oven to 425 F during the last 30 minutes of the
final rising.  Slip the loaf onto the tiles (if you're not using
them, simply put the baking sheet in the preheated oven) and bake for
15 minutes, then lower the heat to 350 F and bake another 35 minutes.
Brush with the remaining olive oil and let cool on rack.

Olive Ladder Bread - Fougasse (Bd)

breads, quick bread, grains

2 1/2 cup lukewarm water
1 teaspoon dry yeast
6 cup unbleached all purpose flour -- (6; to 7)
2 tablespoon olive oil plus extra for oiling sur; faces
2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup pitted and chopped black olives (ny; ons or
1  kalamata)
1/4 cup buckwheat flour

Recipe by: BAKER'S DOZEN SHOW #BD1A29 You will need a large bread
bowl, four 10- by 15- inch or larger baking sheets that will fit in
pairs side-by-side in your oven, a sharp knife or razor blade, and a
pastry brush. Place water in a large bowl, sprinkle on yeast, then
stir in 2 1/2 cups of the all purpose flour. Stir 100 times in the
same direction (one minute) to develop the gluten, then leave this
sponge covered with plastic wrap for 30 minutes or up to two hours.
Stir in olive oil, salt, olives, and buckwheat flour. Mix in
remaining flour, a cup at a time, stirring always in the same
direction, until dough becomes too stiff to stir. Turn dough out onto
a well floured working surface. Using floured hands, knead gently
until the dough has an even consistency (apart from the olives), then
knead 5 minutes longer. Clean bread bowl, oil it lightly, place dough
in the bowl, then cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for 2 to 3 hours.
It will have almost doubled in  volume. Oil two 10 by 15 inch (or
larger) baking sheets. Flatten dough down gently with your hands,
then turn out onto floured working surface. Cut dough in half, return
half to the bread bowl and cover. Divide remaining half in two. Knead
each half into a ball and then flatten gently with the palm of your
hand. Let stand five minutes to rest. Working with each piece in
turn, flatten out with your palms into a rectangle or oval about 10
inches long and 5 to 6 inches wide. It will be about 1/2 to 3/4 inch
thick. Transfer each to a lightly oiled baking sheet at least 14
inches long. Let loaves rise for 20 to 30 minutes, covered with a
damp towel or plastic wrap. Preheat oven to 400 degrees and set rack
at the center of the oven or just above. (If your baking sheets do
not fit side-by-side on one rack, place two racks in oven, one just
above the center and one just below. One bread can go on each rack;
about halfway through baking (after 10 to  12 minutes), switch the
two around.) Just before placing in the oven, use a sharp knife or
razor blade to make cuts through the breads: Starting two inches from
the top and about an inch from the side, cut across the bread to
within an inch of the other side. Make two more cuts,  parallel to
the first, at about 2 inch intervals (the cuts should go all the way
through the dough). The dough will separate at each cut, so that the
bread looks like a kind of fat-runged ladder; you can pull dough
apart even more if you wish and if your baking sheets are long
enough, by pulling gently on each end of the breads to make the slits
gape more. Brush each loaf lightly with olive oil all over, place in
the oven, and bake for 20 minutes. Breads will be golden when done.
Once first two loaves are in the oven, oil two more baking sheets,
then flatten remaining dough, divide into two, and repeat steps
required to form loaves. Breads should almost have finished rising by
the time the first batch comes out of the oven. Yield: 4 loaves

Olive Nut Sandwich

appetizers, breads, sandwich

6 oz cream cheese
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup pecans,chopped
1 cup salad olives
2 tablespoon olive juice
1 dash pepper
1  bread
1  lettuce

Let cream cheese stand at room temperature until soft. Mash with a
fork and add mayonnaise. Add chopped pecans, olives, olive juice and
pepper. Stir well. This will be mushy. Refrigerate in pint jar for at
least 24 -48 hours.  It will then become thick. (Believe it or not.)
You will have nearly a pint of delectable spread! It's best served on
very thin toast or fresh, thinly sliced bread will do. A little
lettuce is a good touch, and cutting into finger tip sizes completes
the feeling of first class.

Olive Oil & Fennel Bread Sticks

breads

3/4 cup warm water
3/4 cup warm beer
1 pint dry yeast
3/4 cup olive oil( good quality! )
1 tablespoon fennel seeds
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
4 1/2 cup flour( approx )
1  glaze:
1  egg
1 tablespoon water

I love the taste of fennel and extra virgin olive oil.

Dissolve yeast in warm water and warm beer for 10 minutes or until
very foamy. Add olive oil, salt and fennel seeds. Mix in 3 1/2 cups
flour and knead until smooth and elastic adding more flour as needed
to prevent stickiness.Place dough in oiled bowl, cover and let rise
double. Punch down dough and divide into 12 balls and divide each
ball into 4 pieces. Roll each piece into a long rope and place on
greased baking sheets at least 1 inch apart. Brush with egg
glaze.Bake immediately, 350 until golden about 30 minutes. Note: I
also like to sprinkle on rosemary, anise or other seeds on the
dough.Plus I make my bread sticks larger by dividing the 12 balls of
dough in 2 or 3 pieces instead of 4. And I also like to brush on
extra virgin olive oil instead of the egg wash over the breadsticks
prior to baking them.then you have to turn them over during baking
and brush more oil on them to brown the other side. I like the taste
good olive oil gives!

Omelettry West's Gingerbread Pancakes

breads

3  egg
1/4 cup sugar, brown
1/2 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup ; water or milk
1/4 cup coffee, brewed
2 1/2 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cloves, ground
1 tablespoon cinnamon
1 tablespoon ginger
1 tablespoon nutmeg
4 tablespoon butter; melted

Cream together the eggs and the brown sugar, then add the buttermilk,
water and coffee. In a separate container sift together the flour,
salt, baking powder, baking soda, cloves, cinnamon, ginger, and
nutmeg. Then combine the liquid and solid ingredients, adding the
melted butter. Cook on a griddle as you would any other pancake. This
recipe may require a fair amount of liquid adjustment. Make sure that
the batter flows off of the spoon fairly evenly, or the pancakes will
be too heavy, and will never cook all the way through without burning
the edges! Serve with butter, maple syrup, honey, or molasses.

Onion Foccacia

breads, snacks, italian, bakery

      ----CRUST----
1/2 tablespoon yeast
1 cup lukewarm water
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon rosemary, ground
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon wheat germ
3 cup flour
      ----TOPPING----
3 medium onions, diced
1 1/2 tablespoon olive oil
1  salt & pepper
1  olive oil, for brushing

In a mixing bowl, combine the yeast, water, sugar, salt, oil &
rosemary. Let stand until the yeast starts to froth. Mix in the wheat
germ & 1 c flour.  Beat well & let sit for 5 minutes. Knead in the
remaining flour & knead until the dough is soft & pliable. Lightly
oil a clean bowl & cover with a towel.  Let rise until doubled in
bulk.

Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet & saute the onions, reduce
heat to low & cook until the onions begin to caramelize. Remove from
heat & set aside. Preheat oven to 350F.

Roll out the dough to fit into a cookie sheet or on a pizza stone.
Lightly sprinkle the cookie sheet with cornmeal & place the dough on
the sheet. Stretch into the corners & build up the edges slightly.
Let rest for 10 minutes.

Brush the dough with olive oil & spread the onions over the top.
Generously salt & grind fresh black pepper over the top. Bake for 25
minutes or until the crusts are done. Cut up & serve immediately or
let cool. This is equally good cold & served at room temperature.

NOTE: I thought this recipe was from "Friendly Foods" by Ron
Pickarski, & it is not.  It is also not in Carol Field's "Italy in
Small Bites", so if someone has the source for this recipe I'll
gladly give it the credit. In the meantime, this is what I do for
onion foccacia & I guess it comes from my head each time.

Onion Twist Bread

breads

4  to 4-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 pkg dry yeast
1/3 cup non-fat dry milk
1 1/2 cup hot tap water (120 - 130 degrees)
2 tablespoon shortening, room temperature
2 tablespoon sugar
1 pkg onion soup mix (1-3/8 ounces)
2 tablespoon grated parmesan cheese
1  egg, room temperature

You will need two medium baking pans (greased or Teflon) or one baking
sheet (greased or Teflon).  If glass pans are used, reduce oven heat
by 25 degrees.

In a large mixer bowl combine 2 cups of flour and the yeast. In a
saucepan measure milk, water, shortening, sugar, soup mix, and
cheese. Stir over a low heat until warm (120 degrees). Pour this into
the dry mixture, add the egg and beat at a low speed in the electric
mixer for 30 seconds. Scrape down bowl. Turn mixer to high for three
minutes. Stop the mixer, and with a wooden spoon gradually stir in
more flour to form a soft dough that will clean the sides of the bowl.

Kneading:

Sprinkle the work surface with flour and turn the dough onto it, Knead
until the dough is smooth and elastic. Cover the dough with the
inverted bowl and let it rest on the counter top for twenty minutes.

Shaping:

To make two twist loaves, divide the dough into 4 parts. Shape each
piece into a smooth 12 inch roll. Twist 2 pieces together and press
ends to seal. Tuck under the sealed ends, place loaf in prepared pan.
Loaves can also be baked on a baking sheet.  Place them 2 inches
apart.

Rising:

Cover with wax paper or foil until doubled in size (about 45 minutes).
Dough will rise to about 1/2 inch above the edge of the pan.

Baking:

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Bake in oven until the crusts have
browned. The loaves will draw away from the sides of the pan. When
tapping, the bottom crust yields a hard, hollow sound, the bread is
done. Remove bread from the oven.  Turn out on metal cooling racks.
Brush with melted butter for a nice soft finish.

medium-soft consistency. Turn out dough onto floured surface and
knead until smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Cover dough and let
rest for 20 minutes.

Grease a heavy baking sheet.  Divide dough into 4 equal pieces and
roll each piece into a ball.  Flatten balls of dough to 3/4"
thickness and place on greased baking sheet. Rub surface of each
bread with remaining butter or oil and lightly sprinkle with
remaining whole fennel seeds, pressing slightly to make seeds stick.
Cover and let rise for 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 425F.  Bake breads until golden brown, about 25
minutes.

Orange Cranberry Muffins

breads, breakfast, bbs

1  orange (i use a large navel
1  _orange with thick rind)
3/4 cup dried cranberries
1  egg
3/4 cup milk
2/3 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 cup flour
2 1/2 tablespoon flour
1 cup sugar
2 tablespoon sugar
1 1/8 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt

The night before: Grate the orange rind. Squeeze the juice from the
orange. Mix the rind, juice, and cranberries in a bowl and
refrigerate overnight.

The next day: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Mix the egg, milk and
vegetable oil in a small bowl. Sift together the flour, sugar, baking
powder, and salt in a large bowl. Add the cranberries (with the juice
and rind) to the flour mixture.  Add the liquid mixture to the dry
mixture. The batter will be runnier than most muffin batters -- but
that's the way it should be. Fill 12 greased muffin cups (or use foil
baking cups to line the muffin cups) with the batter and bake for
25    minutes.

These muffins are very moist and tasty.  The rather strange
measurements of flour and sugar are the result of my reducing the end
result from 4 dozen muffins to
1    dozen.

baking soda, pumpkin pie spice, salt and baking powder. I a second
bowl stir together remaining ingredients until well mixed.  Add
pumpkin mixture to flour mixture and stir until all ingredients are
well moistened. Pour batter into loaf pans. Bake 65 minutes or until
breads test done with wooden pick. Cool in pans 10 minutes then
remove to cooling racks. Completely cool breads then drizzle glaze
over top and sides.  Makes 2 loaves. Glaze: In a small bowl, with
fork, mix 1 cup powdered sugar, 1/4 cup undiluted orange juice
concentrate and 1/8 teaspoon allspice, until smooth. Drizzle over the
cooled breads. (To be perfectly accurate I use this orange juice
glaze on many items during the course of 2 weeks, so I use a 6 oz can
of frozen oj concentrate, effectively tripling the recipe. This is a
hint). *use Ocean-Spray 16 oz can, if available.

2 1/2 cup warm water (105-110 f.)
7 cup bread flour, unsifted
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon butter; melted
1  egg white; mixed with...
1 tablespoon water
1  cornmeal for dusting
      ----FILLING----
2  garlic cloves; chopped
1 tablespoon dijon mustard
3/4 cup finely chopped hazelnuts (oregon ha; zelnuts)
1/3 cup olive oil
1/2 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes
1/4 cup butter, soft
1 cup grated swiss cheese

Thoroughly mix all filling ingredients together and set aside.

Dissolve yeast in warm water. Add salt and butter, blend until well
mixed. Knead until dough is elastic and smooth, about 10 minutes.
Place in greased bowl, cover and let rise until doubled, about 1
hour. Divide dough into 2 pieces and roll into oblong pieces 15x12
inches. Spread each with 1/2 of the filling. Roll up sealing as you
roll. Place on greased baking sheets dusted with cornmeal, seam side
down. Let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Make 3 or 4 diagonal cuts
on each loaf. Bake in 450 oven for 25 minutes. Remove, brush with egg
white and water mix, bake 5 minutes more.

For best results, keep oven very hot and place a pan with 1 inch of
water on the bottom rack. This steam will create the classic crunchy
crust of good French bread.

breads, flatbread, georgia

1 1/2 teaspoon olive oil
1/3 cup onions; finely chopped
1 cup cooked potato; diced
2 tablespoon yogurt; low-fat plain
1/4 cup feta cheese; crumbled 2oz
1/4 cup parsley; chop coarsely or cilantro
2  scallions; thinly sliced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1  salt and pepper to taste

:       To prepare filling: Heat oil in a nonstick skillet over
medium-high heat. add onions and cook, stirring, until lightly brown,
about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
:       Using a potato masher, mash the potatoes until smooth,
blending in yogurt and the reserved onions. Add feta, parsley,
scallions, and salt and pepper. set aside.
:       To make dough: Set oven rack in lowest position. If you have
quarry tiles or a baking stone, place on the rack. Preheat the oven
to 450 Degrees F. Lightly oil 2 baking sheets or coat them with
nonstick cooking spray.
:        In a large bowl, combine 1 cup of the flour with the baking
soda and salt. stir in yogurt. gradually add just enough of the
remaining flour until the dough has lost its stickiness and can be
worked with your hands. Turn the dough out onto a lightly flour work
surface and knead until soft and slightly elastic, 3 to 4 minutes.
divide the dough into 8 equal pieces.
:       To assemble and bake breads: Working with one piece at a
time, and keeping the remaining dough covered, flatten the dough with
the palm of your hand, then either stretch or roll out the dough to a
circle 6 to 8 inches in diameter.
:       Spoon 2 Tb of the filling on the the center of the dough.
Gently stretch the edges of the dough over the filling until you have
a dough-covered mound. Pinch pleats closed and then, with the palm of
your hand, gently press down on the top of the mound to flatten it.
Turn the bread over and press again on the other side. this will push
the filling to the edges of the bread. It should now be not more than
1/2 : thick and 7 to 8 inches in diameter.
:       Transfer the filled circles, pleated side down, to a prepared
baking sheet. Once the first baking sheet is full bake the breads on
the lowest rack (or with the sheet directly on the quarry tiles or
baking stone)) for 6 to 8 minutes or until the breads are lightly
browned on the bottom. Assemble the remaining breads while the first
batch bakes. Remove the breads from the oven and transfer to a basket
lined with a towel. Bake the remaining breads in the same fashion.

1 pinch salt
2 tablespoon cold butter, cut in small pieces
1 cup to 1 1/3 c milk
1  milk to bush on scones

sheet; set aside.  Sift flour, baking poder and salt into a large
bowl. With your fingers, rub in butter until mixture is crumbly. Make
a well in center of mixture; add milk and mix with a fork to make a
dough that BARELY holds together (you may need to press dough
together with your hands). Turn out onto a floured surface and knead
lightly just until smooth. Roll out with a floured rolling pin or pat
dough with your hands to make a round about 3/4-inch thick. Cut in
rounds with a 2-inch fluted or plain cookie cutter. Arrange 1 to 1
1/2-inches apart on baking sheet; brush tops lightly with milk.  Bake
8 to 10 minutes or until well risen and golden. Transfer to a wire
rack and cool 5 minutes.  Split and serve warm with clotted cream (if
you can get it!) or sweet butter or whipped cream, plus strawberry
preserves. Makes about 12 scones. VARIATIONS: Rich Oven Scones: Add 1
tablespoon sugar to the dry ingredients. In place of the 2/3 cup
milk, use a mixture of 1 lightly beaten egg and 5 tablespoons milk.

Owendaw Corn Bread

breads

1 cup cooked hominy
2 tablespoon butter
2  eggs
1 cup milk
1/2 cup cornmeal
1/2 teaspoon salt

Hominy gives this bread it's distinctive flavor. Like all spoon
breads, it should be eaten very hot with plenty of butter. Do try
this one it will change your mind about grits.

This recipe orignally appeared in The Carolina Housewife. The last
line in the recipe is taken verbatim from the orignal by the authors.

While hominy is hot, stir in the butter. Beat eggs until light and
add to hominy, then add milk. Stir in cornmeal and salt. This makes a
very thin batter. Pour into a deep, buttered pan and bake in a 375
degree F. oven for about 30 minutes (about 1 hour in a glass baking
dish). This will serve 6.

When baked, it has the appearance of a baked batter pudding, and when
rich and well mixed it has almost the delicacy of baked custard.

Pampushky (Raised Doughnuts With Filling)

breads, christmas, russian

2 tablespoon sugar
1/2 cup ; water
2 pkg active dry yeast
1/4 cup milk
5 cup unbleached all-purpose flour; up to 6 may be needed
1/4 lb butter; 1 stick
1/2 cup sugar
2 large eggs
3 large egg yolks
1 teaspoon salt; if using sweet butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1  zest of one lemon
1 cup rose preserve or any dry fruit pres; erve
1  powdered sugar; as needed

Combine the sugar and water, sprinkle with the yeast, and let stand
until soft.  Heat the milk to lukewarm, and add the milk and 1/4 cup
of the flour to the yeast mixture. Beat well, cover and allow to rise
until light and bubbly, about 10 minutes.  In another bowl, cream the
butter and sugar. Beat eggs and egg yolks together, blending well and
combine with the sugar-butter mixture, beating thoroughly until the
eggs are pale white. Grate a lemon on a fine grater until all of the
yellow color is grated off and add this (the zest), vanilla, and the
yeast mixture to the butter-egg mixture.  Mix in 4 cups of flour.  If
the dough seems a little loose, add a little more, but the dough
should be soft. Knead, by hand, for about 10 minutes.  Replace in a
greased bowl, turning once to grease the top, and cover with a damp
towel, set in a warm place until double in bulk. Punch down, knead a
few more times, and allow to rise again until the dough is doubled.
When doubled, divide the dough into 4 parts. On a lightly floured
surface, roll one part into a rectangle about 1/4-inch thick, turning
once or twice during the rolling to achieve a uniform thickness. Dust
with flour sparingly.  Place 1 ts of rose preserve at evenly space
intervals on the dough, or with a 2 1/2-inch cutter, gently form
impressions and place the filling in each.  Roll another portion out,
as above, to the same thickness, and gently cover the first,
overlapping a little. (Filling will show through.) Cut circles with
the cutter. Place them on a lightly floured cookie sheet and allow
rise until double in size. Repeat until all of the dough is used,
rolling out the scraps last. Heat oil or shortening to 375 degrees F.
in a deep fryer or wide skillet. Test the temperature by frying a
piece of bread; it should bubble and turn golden quickly. The fat
should not be smoking.  Fry 5 or 6 pampushky at a time. Do NOT crowd
as this lowers the temperature and the doughnuts will absorb too much
grease. When one side is golden, flip with a spoon to fry the other
side. Dough will puff up in the frying.  Perfect pampushky are light
as air. Drain on paper towels. When slightly cooled, sprinkle with
powdered sugar.

Serve with tea.

Pane Basso (Tuscan Country Bread)

breads, italian

2 oz fresh yeast
500 ml warm water
2 lb strong white flour

("Strong white flour" is a UK term for all-purpose flour. Use bread
flour if you can get it, preferably unbleached.) Dissolve the yeast
in 150 ml of the warm water in a small bowl. Sift in enough of the
flour to make a soft dough, mixing with the hands.  Cover and put in
a warm place to rise. When the yeast dough has at least doubled in
size, begin making the rest of the dough.  Sift the remaining flour
onto a wood or marble surface. Make a well in the middle;  pour a
little water into it and begin working the flour towards this with
your hands. When the dough has absorbed enough water to bind
together, add the yeast dough and work in. Knead for 5-10 minutes,
occasionally lifting the dough and smacking it on the table.
Continue until it no longer sticks to your hands. Sprinkle a large
bowl with water and put the dough into it. Cover with a cloth and let
rise until doubled in size (about 30 minutes).  Knead again 5-10
minutes and form into two balls.  Let stand another 20 minutes, and
then bake on a greased, floured baking tin until crusty (about 30
minutes) in an oven preheated to 350.

Panettone (Ecco Il Pane)

breads, fruits, italian, christmas

      ----SPONGE/DOUGH #1----
2 1/2 teaspoon dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (105-115 f)
1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
      ----DOUGH #2----
2 1/2 teaspoon dry yeast
3 tablespoon warm water
1  dough #1
2  eggs (@ room temp.)
1 1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
      ----DOUGH #3----
2  eggs (@ room temp)
3  egg yolks (@ room temp)
3/4 tablespoon honey
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon salt
1  dough #2
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
3 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
3/4 cup flour for kneading dough
      ----FILLING----
1/2 cup dark raisins
1/3 cup currants
1/3 cup dried cranberries
1 cup candied mixed peel
1  grated zest of 2 lemons

Sponge/Dough #1: In a medium bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm
water and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Add flour, and
stir with a wooden spoon until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and
let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.

Dough #2 (When dough #1 has risen): In a large bowl, dissolve yeast
in warm water and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Add dough
#1 (it will have a very loose consistency) to the yeast mix and stir
well. Add the eggs, flour, sugar and stir until well mixed. Cover the
dough with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in vloume, about 1
hour.

Dough #3 (When dough #2 has finished rising): In a large bowl, combine
eggs, yolks, sugar, honey, vanilla extract, and salt. Add dough #2,
it will have a very loose consistency, and mix well. Add the softened
butter, mix well.

Add the 3 cups flour (1 cup at a time) and coninue stirring until the
dough has a soft texture, like soft cookie dough. Turn out on a well
floured surface and knead gently, adding the last 3/4 cup flour as
needed. Knead until the dough is soft and smooth and holds it's
shape. Be careful not to create lumps.

Lightly butter a very large bowl, enough to allow the dough to triple
in volume. Place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with the
butter, cover with plastic wrap and let rise until tripled, about 3
hours.

Filling: (can be mixed while waiting for dough to rise): Mix raisins,
currants and dried cranberries in a small bowl. Cover with warm water
and allow to soften for 10 minutes. Drain and pat dry. Mix in the
finely chopped peel and lemon zest. Set aside.

When the dough has triple in volume, turn out on a lightly floured
surface and pat down into an oval or rectangle about 1/2" thick.
Sprinkle half the filling mix over the dough, and roll up jellyroll
fashion along the long edge. Again pat down into an oval shape about
1/2" thick and sprinkle the remaining filing mix over the dough. Roll
up jellyrool fashion along the long edge.

Divide the dough into 3 pieces; two pieces should be about 1/3 larger
than the third piece. Butter the bottoms and sides of two 300g coffee
cans and one 398ml can. Line the bottoms and sides with waxed paper.

Gently roll the dough into balls and place the two larger pieces into
the two larger cans and the small piece into the small can. Cover
with plastic wrap and allow to double in volume, about 2 hours. Once
the dough has risen, cut a small 'X' in the top of each loaf and bake
in a preheated 400 F (200 C) oven for 10 minutes. Reduce temp. to 375
F (190 C) for another 10 minutes. Again reduce the oven to 350 F (180
C) and bake for 15 minutes loger for the small can and 30 minutes for
the large cans; or until a wooden skewer comes out clean when
inserted into the bread.

Cool the breads in their cans on a rack for 30 minutes. Carefully
unmold the breads and lay on their sides, on a rack, until cooled.
Best eaten within 48 hours.

NOTES: I baked this recipe in 5 1/2 " high clay flour pots lined with
foil. The recipe filled two pots. I baked at 400 F for 15 mins. then
turned the oven down to 325 F for about 50 mins. The bread was done
when a skewer came out clean. Make sure the butter is well softened
or it will be almost impossible to mix in well.

Parmesan Crackers

breads

8 tablespoon (1 stick) butter or
1  margarine, softened
2 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cup (about 8 ounces) finely
1  grated parmesan cheese
1  egg yolk
1/2 cup water

"Parmesan Crackers are great with a cold beer or soda. Once you have
started eating them, it is nearly impossible to stop. 350~F. 15 to 20
minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F. In a large bowl or in the food
processor, cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles
coarse meal. Add the cheese and egg yolk and mix well. Add enough of
the water to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.
The texture will be somewhat crumbly, but the dough will hold
together when pressed. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for
rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll each into a
rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Cut out individual crackers about 2
inches across with a cookie cutter or sharp knife and arrange them on
an ungreased baking sheet. Prick each cracker 2 or 3 times with the
tines of a fork. Bake for 10 minutes. Turn the crackers over and bake
another 5 to 10 minutes, or until medium brown. Cool the crackers on
a rack. Yield: 40-50.

Parslied Buttermilk Biscuits

breads

2 1/2 cup flour; divided
5 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
4 cup shortening
4 tablespoon parsley, fresh; chopped
4 cup buttermilk

Preheat oven to 500F.  Lightly grease a large cookie sheet. Sift 1
1/2 cups of the flour and the salt into a large bowl, setting remain-
ing flour aside in a small bowl. Cut the shortening into the flour
mixture with a pastry blender or a fork until the mixture resembles
coarse meal; stir in the chopped parsley. Pour in the buttermilk all
at once and stir with a fork until the mixture just holds together.
Do not overwork; the dough should be wet and a little lumpy. Flour
hands with reserved flour and pull of a 1/4 cup piece of wet dough.
Toss the dough lightly in the bowl of flour to coat; roll gently into
a smooth ball between palms of hands. The inside of the biscuit will
still be very wwet; place biscuit carefully on the prepared cookie
sheet. Repeat the procedure with the remaining dough, flouring the
hands as necessary and placing the formed biscuits on the cookie
sheet so they just touch.. Pat each biscuit gently to flatten
slightly. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes until golden brown. Makes about 8
biscuits. Nutrition Information per biscuit:

Pasta Frittata

appetizers, breads, pasta, cheese, eggs

4  egg
2 cup cooked spaghetti -- cut 1 in
1  lengths
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 cup parmesan cheese -- grated
2 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup mozzarella cheese -- diced
2 large roma tomatoes -- diced
2  green onions -- chopped
2 oz prosciutto -- sliced
2 tablespoon italian parsley -- chopped

1. In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs. Mix in the spaghetti,
pepper and grated Parmesan.

2. In a medium non-stick skillet, heat the oil over medium flame. Add
half of the pasta mixture, spreading it out to the edges like a
pancake. Spread the diced mozzarella in a single layer on top, then
layer on the tomatoes, green onions and prosciutto. Finish by
spreading the remaining pasta on top and pouring any egg left in the
bowl over it. Cook on low until the bottom is browned and crisp,
about 5 minutes.

3. When the bottom has set and is golden brown, flip the frittata
over, using either a large spatula or sliding it onto a plate and
then inverting it back into the pan. Cook, uncovered, another 5
minutes, or until the bottom is crisp and golden.

4. To serve, slide the frittata out of the pan. Cut into 4 wedges and
sprinkle with chopped parsley. Serve warm or at room temperature.
NOTES:

The Italian omelette, known as a frittata, varies from the traditional
French omelette in 3 ways. First, the frittata fillings are beaten in
with the eggs, instead of being folded inside. Second, the frittata
may be finished by either flipping over the whole omelette in the
pan, or running it under the broiler. Third, as described above,
whereas the French omelette is folded, the Italian frittata is cooked
in one, round piece. Both types have their attributes, and preference
is merely a matter of taste.

I am, however, partial to this particular frittata recipe. Pasta,
which can be leftover from a previous meal, is cooked in the eggs
with layers of tomatoes, cheese, seasonings and prosciutto. This is a
wonderfully simple yet absolutely delectable omelette, and it can
even be made in advance. The recipe makes 4 small to medium-size
portions, enough for a light breakfast or first course. If desired,
add 2 more eggs and increase the other ingredients accordingly for a
heartier, more substantial meal.

Peach Leaf Starter

breads

1 quart fresh peach leaves, unpacked
3 cup water
3  baked potatoes, medium size
1/2 cup yellow corn meal
3 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoon salt

Bring water to rolling boil and steep peach leaves in it for 15
minutes. Drain liquid and add enough water to make 3 full cups again.
This will have a rather unappetizing green color but don't worry! It
will disappear during the fermentation process.  Peel hot baked
potatoes and put through food mill or sieve. Scald 1/2 cup corn meal
in 1 cup of the liquid until it reaches boiling point and thickens.
Stir constantly so that it will not become lumpy.  Now combine all
ingredients in large mixing bowl (do not use metal or plastic).
Cover with cheesecloth and set in a warm place (80-85) until well
fermented.  In warm humid weather this will take about 24 hours. In
cool dry weather a few more hours may be required for mixture to
become active.  Stir every few hours.  When it is ready, pour into a
large glass jar.  Store in refrigerator at about 38 degrees. If
necessary stir down a time or two until it stops foaming. It is ready
for use when about 1/2 inch of clear liquid has risen to the top.
This will take about 2 days. Stir well before using.

When this starter has been used down to about 1 cupful, add 3 cups
water, 3 medium sized baked potatoes, 1/2 cup corn meal scalded in 1
cup of the water, 3 Tbsp. sugar and 2 tsp. salt prepared as for the
first time (peach leaves are not needed).  Set in warm place until it
becomes very active in about 6 to 8 hours. Store in refrigerator and
it will be ready for use the next day.  A properly renewed starter
improves with age and, once one becomes accustomed to taking care of
it, it all becomes automatic. When, for some reason, it cannot be
used about twice a week, stir it thoroughly every few days and add 1
tsp. sugar. Scald jar and lid before filling each time.

Peanut Butter Bread

breads

3 medium potato; peeled/chopped
5 cup flour; divided
1/4 cup sugar, brown
2 teaspoon salt
2 pkg yeast, dry
1/4 cup shortening
1  egg; beaten
1/2 cup peanut butter, chunky

Cook potatoes in boiling water to cover 10 minutes or until tender.
Drain potatoes, reserving two cups water (add water to make 2 cups if
neces- sary).  Reserve potatoes for another use; set potato water
aside.

Combine two cups flour, sugar, salt, and yeast; mix well.  Set aside.

Combine potato water and shortening in a saucepan; cook, stirring con-
stantly, until shortening melts.  Cool to 110 F., and pour over flour
mixture.  Mix on low speed of an electric mixer until blended.  Add
egg and peanut butter, mixing until ingredients are well blended.
Gradually stir in enough of remaining flour to make a soft dough.

Turn dough out on a floured surface, and knead until smooth and
elastic. Place in a well-greased bowl, turning to grease top.  Cover
and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled (about an
hour).

Punch dough down and halve.  Turn each portion out on a lightly
floured surface, and roll out to a 14"x7" rectangle; fold and
re-roll.  Starting with the narrow end, roll tightly as for a
jellyroll.

Pinch the seams together to seal edges.  Place loaves, seam side
down, in two well-greased loaf pans.  Cover and let rise again until
doubled (about 45 minutes).  Bake at 375 F. for 40 to 50 minutes.

1  brown sugar
1  light karo syrup
1  chopped walnuts or pecans

Put yeast and 1 tbl sugar and water in a large bowl. Set aside. Scald
the milk, take off heat.  Add oil, 1/2 cup sugar, salt and cool to
lukewarm.
In a separate bowl, mix eggs and milk mixture.  Slowly add flour.
Knead lightly, place in a lightly greased bowl and let rise until
double in size. Punch down, take about 1/3 of the dough and roll to
about 1/4" thick. Spread with the following...
Melted butter, sprinkle with white sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon.
Roll dough and cut about 1" thick.  Put in *Prepared Pans*
(directions to follow).  Cover and let rise until double in size.
Bake at 350 for 25-30 minutes.  Let stand for about 1 minute, loosen
rolls from the sides of the pan and turn out on wax paper to cool.
(at least to cool enough so you can pick them up to eat cause they
are best when warm.)
***** Prepared pans:  Lightly grease bottom and sides of pan. Put a
thin layer of brown sugar on bottom, chopped walnuts or pecans also.
Lightly drizzle melted butter over the sugar and nuts, then lightly
drizzle white karo syrup over the mixture.  If you add too much brown
sugar, butter and syrup all the "sticky" will run off when cooling.
You have to experiment a little to see how much to add to your liking.

Pennsylvania Altar Bread

breads

7/8 cup water, lukewarm (about 110 degrees; f.)
3 tablespoon honey
1 1/2 teaspoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pkg yeast (dry), active
2 2/3 cup flour, whole wheat (unsifted)

Combine water and yeast in mixing bowl.  Add honey, olive oil and salt. Add
flour.  If flour does not completely dampen, add small amounts of water
until all of the flour is damp. Be sparing with the water.

Turn out onto a very lightly floured board and knead thoroughly for 5
minutes until dough is extremely elastic.

Sprinkle a tiny amount of olive oil in a big bowl, then roll the dough in
it until the dough is covered with olive oil. Leave the dough in the bowl,
cover with a cloth, and let rise for 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in size.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Punch the dough down, knead again for a few
seconds.  Roll the dough out with a rolling pin, as if you were making a
pizza crust, to a thickness of about 1/4 inch.

Using something like a large peanut butter jar or a giant cookie cutter,
cut out about 4-inch circles of the dough and lift them onto a
slightly-oiled baking sheet. Press a cross into the top surface of each, so
that it can be easily broken apart.

Bake the loaves, on their baking sheet, in a preheated 350 degree F. oven
for 10 minutes.

NOTES:

*  An earthy, whole-wheat bread used for communion -- In Pittsburgh and
other Western Pennsylvania parishes of the Episcopal church, it is common
to use small, thin loaves of real, fresh, home-made bread at communion
instead of the pressed wafers popular in most other places. The bread has a
chewy texture to it, keeps tremendously well, and makes a great lunchbox
food (each "loaf" is about the size a large cookie). This recipe comes from
Father Bill Coats of the Church of the Redeemer in Pittsburgh. Yield: 8-10
single-serving loaves.

*  You can freeze these loaves easily; either put them in single-serving
ziploc bags and use them for school lunches, or freeze a bunch in a large
food-storage bag.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 2 hours rising, 10 minutes baking.

Peppery Corn Bread Bites

breads

1 pkg (7 1/2 to 12 ounces) cornbread muff; in mix
3/4 cup (3 ounces) shredded sharp cheddar c; heese
1 1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper

I forget what kinds of recipes you like.  Here are a couple of easy
looking cornbread recipes from a new book a friend gave me.

From:  Working Mother 29-Minute Meals

Preheat oven to 425 deg.F.  Grease 8-inch square baking pan. Prepare
corn bread mix according to package directions, adding cheese to
batter. Pour batter into prepared pan; sprinkle evenly with black
pepper. Bake for 15 minutes, or until golden brown and toothpick
inserted into center comes out clean. Cut corn bread into squares.

Makes about 12 squares.

Per square:  160 calories, 4 g protein, 6 g fat, 21 g carbohydrate,
27 mg cholesterol, 348 mg sodium.

This one also looks good.  From same book as above.

Herbed Corn Bread

Bake this savory cornbread in the morning and serve at room
temperature--or if desired, reheat it briefly before serving.

2 boxes (8 1/2-ounce size) cornbread or corn muffin mix 1/2 cup
cottage cheese 1/4 cup minced parsley 1/4 cup snipped fresh chives or
scallions

1.  Preheat oven to 350 deg.F.  Grease several corn-stick molds or
two 8 inch square baking pans. Set aside.

2.  Prepare mixes according to package directions, adding cottage
cheese, parsley and chives to batter. Spoon into prepared molds. Bake
for 12 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned (corn bread baked in
square pans will take about 25 minutes).

Makes 12 servings.

Per serving:  179 calories, 4 g protein, 5 g fat, 28 g carbohydrate,
1 mg cholesterol, 455 mg sodium.

My Note:  Even if you dislike cottage cheese, when cottage cheese is
baked into breads and the like it looses its cottage-cheese-ness ;-)
and just tends to make the breads moist. Also, you could probably add
smidgens of other herbs to this last bread... tiny bits of basil or
oregano or thyme, to give it just a hint of herby flavor.

Take care, Kyosho

Perfect Buttermilk Biscuit

breads, breakfast

1/2 cup shortening
2 1/4 cup flour
2 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cup buttermilk

Place shortening in small plastic food bag. Flatten shortening between
plastic sheets so it is thin and return to freezer. This allows
shortening to become hard enough to break, into tiny pieces when
added to dry ingredients. Tear 2 pieces wax paper about 15 inches
long and place on counter, Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda,
sugar and salt onto wax paper. Place empty sifter on top of bare
sheet of wax paper, lift sheet of wax paper holding sifted dry
ingredients by sides and pour through sifter, sifting onto bare wax
paper. Sift back and forth 3 times, then sift once more into large
mixing bowl. Remove shortening from freezer. Cut into small bits,
about 1/4-inch square. Drop shortening bits into bowl of dry
ingredients and, using fingertips, lightly rub shortening and flour
together, occasionally tossing flour mixture so you touch all
particles of shortening with flour. When mixture has bits of
flour-covered shortening throughout, begin adding buttermilk. Using
fork, add buttermilk, lightly stirring to mix with dry ingredients.
Cover board or surface with dusting of flour. Gather sticky mass of
dough and place on floured surface. Dust hands with flour and gently
knead dough, adding enough flour only to make dough manageable. Pat
dough with hands or roll with floured rolling pin into round 1/2-inch
thick. Using 2-inch cutter, cut out biscuits and place touching each
other in 3 rows, in center of greased baking sheet. Place on middle
rack of 425-degree oven and bake 12 minutes, or until lightly golden.
Remove from oven and serve hot or warm. Makes 19 (2-inch round)
biscuits. ***NOTE::By Marion Cunningham Thanks to Eula Mae Dore, a
great Southern cook from Avery Plantation, La., I've learned to make
the best Buttermilk Biscuits I've ever had. Eula Mae says a good
biscuit is one of the best things to have on hand for quick meals.
She uses them in emergencies to make simple sandwiches filled with
scraps of ham or cheese and serves them with pickles and a small
salad. For dessert, she warms a biscuit or two and makes a shortcake
with fresh fruits or berries. She has convinced me that you can't
have too many biscuits on hand. Eula Mae learned to cook and bake
from her grandmother, not from cookbooks, and the artfulness of her
preparation was a joy to watch. Here are some of her biscuit-making
tips: + First go out and replace your baking powder, unless you
bought it within the last four months. More baking flops occur from
old, tired baking powder than from any other cause. And don't rely on
the old test of checking the freshness of baking powder by putting a
spoonful in a glass of water to see if it fizzes. Baking powder, like
a carbonated drink, can fizz a little and still be almost flat.
Buying new baking powder costs very little when you consider the cost
of baking failures. + Next, Eula Mae insists that sifting the dry
ingredients four times is the reason her biscuits are perfect. I
tested the recipe sifting and not sifting and, indeed, sifting does
make a slightly higher, more tender biscuit. + After you cut the
biscuit dough, put the pieces on a baking sheet upside down. This
ensures a taller, lighter biscuit by making sure any edges crimped by
the pressure of the cutting don't interfere with the rise. (The
French use the same trick when making puff pastry.) + The tip that
helped me the most was using less flour than usual. Eula Mae's dough
was soft and sticky. She handled it gently, dusting her hands and the
dough with only enough flour to make the dough manageable. The result
was a lighter biscuit.

Perfect White Bread

breads

1/2 cup warm water
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon ginger
2 pkg active or dry yeast
1/3 cup sugar
2 1/2 cup warm water
4 cup flour
3/4 cup skimmed milk powder
3 cup warm water
5 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup soft lard
8 cup flour (for the dough)
2 cup flour (for kneading)

Combine the first 4 ingredients and let stand in a warm place until
bubbling nicely. In a large bowl, stir together 1/3 cup Sugar, 2 1/2
cups Water, 4 cups flour, and 3/4 cup dried skim milk. Stir in the
yeast mixture, beating well. Cover the bowl and let stand in a warm
place until the sponge is well risen and bubbly. Add 3 cups warm
water, 5 teaspoons salt, and 1/2 cup lard and beat well. Stir in 6 to
8 cups flour, mixing until the dough clears the bowl. Spread the
remaining 2 cups of flour on a pastry board, turn out the dough and
knead well, using a little additional flour if necessary to make it
smooth and satiny. Return to the bowl, dust top of dough with flour,
cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place for about 30
minutes. Turn out. Knead thoroughly, using only enough flour to keep
dough from sticking. Divide into 6 even portions. Shape into loaves.
Place in greased pans. Brush tops of loaves with soft lard and allow
to rise again until double in bulk. Bake in PREHEATED oven for 45
minutes; the first 20 minutes at 425 F.; then reduce heat to 350 F.
for the rest of the baking period. If a very soft crust is desired,
brush top of loaves with melted lard or butter as soon as they are
removed from the oven and allow to stand for about 5 minutes before
removing from the pans. This recipe makes 6 medium size loaves.

Philly Soft Pretzels

breads

1 tablespoon dry yeast
1 1/4 cup warm water  4 c flour
2 teaspoon salt
1  kosher or margarita salt

Dissolve yeast thoroughly in 1/4 cup warm water.  Mix 3 cups flour
and salt in large bowl.  Add yeast with remaining 1 cup water. Add
enough additional flour to make dough stiff. Knead 10 minutes or till
dough feels elastic. Form into ball.  Place in bowl and spread with
butter. Cover with towel and let rise till doubled, about 45 minutes.
Divide dough into 12 small balls and roll between hands (or on
counter) to form a rope. Form into pretzel shapes, wetting and
pinching ends firmly. Dissolve baking soda in 4 cups water and bring
to a boil. Drop pretzels, a few at a time, in water and boil till
they float to the top, about 1 minute. Remove and drain. Place on
buttered baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and bake at 475 for 15-20
minutes or till golden brown. Place on rack to cool. I used to make
these a lot when my husband had to do field time in the army.
According to all the guys, they warm up pretty good and are excellent
with some German scharfer senf (sharp/hot mustard).

Piadini

breads, italian

3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
3 tablespoon oliye oil
1/2 cup (generous) mixture of half milk, ha; lf water

I'm not much of a baker, but these recipes for an Italian bread and
sauteed greens to stuff in it sounded good...

Mix flour, salt and baking powder in a large bowl. Make a well in the
center and pour in the olive oil and a little of the milk-water
mixture. Start to mix the dough with a fork, gradually adding the
rest of the liquid; you probably will need extra water, depending on
the absorbency of the flour.

When the dough has come together and leaves the sides of the bowl
clean, form it into a rough ball and put it on a very lightly floured
surface. Knead until it is smooth, about 10 minutes. Let rest for 10
to 30 minutes, at your convenience.

When the dough has rested divide it into small balls, each about the
size of a plum.  Roll each ball out into a flat circle about 1/8-inch
thick. Now put the heavy pan or bakestone on medium heat. Let the pan
become hot enough to make a drop of water dance.

Put the first piadina in the pan and press down with a wooden
spatula. Let cook on one side for 20 seconds or so++when you lift it
to turn it over it should have whitened, and there will be the faint
beginnings of small brown scorch marks.  Repeat with the second side
and turn the bread 2 or 3, times during cooking.

When the bread is ready it will have puffed up like a pocket bread and
should have small brown spots over its surface; as soon as you have
achieved this effect, put the cooked piadina on a wire cake rack and
proceed with the next one.

Serve hot, with slices of prosciutto, salami or cheese, and perhaps
olives, radishes or a little tomato for a quick lunch.

Makes 10 to 12 breads.

Combine dry ingredients and cut in shortening. Dissolve baking soda

400F oven for 10 minutes.
This recipe comes from the county where the Scots first landed in
Canada (and where my dad was born.)
To  quote the author, "Our Scottish ancestors used "real" oatmeal when
they made their favorite oatcakes. However sugar did creep in, as
indicated by this 75 year old recipe. (The book was published in 1971
so the recipe would be form the year 1894.)

Pierogi (Dough Pockets)

breads

4 cup flour
4 medium eggs
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup water

Pierogi (Dough Pockets) Oil

Place flour in a bowl or on a kneading board.  Mix eggs, salt and
water, beating slightly.  Add mixture to flour and knead until the
dough is firm. Divide dough in half or quarters and cover with warm
bowl or towel and let dough rest for 10 to 20 minutes.

Take a piece of dough and roll it out thin on a floured board. Cut
circles (approximately 5 inches in diameter) with a cookie or biscuit
cutter. Place small amout of desired filling in the center of dough,
fold in half, firmly pressing edges together.  Repeat until all dough
and filling has been used.

Fill large pot with water (approximately 3 inches from the top), add a
pinch of salt and about 2 ounces of oil. Bring water to a boil and,
while keeping water boiling, gently place pierogi in boiling water.
Pierogi will rise to the top.  Cook about 5 minutes. Remove gently
with a skimmer or slotted spoon and place in a flat roasting pan
containing about 1 inch of oil.

Allow to cool, remove and place on a cookie sheet or platter till
cold.

Note: Add water to pot as needed.  If water should get starchy
(milky), discard and start over with a pot of fresh water.

When pierogi is cold, place in a  plastic bag and store in
refrigerator or freezer until ready to use. Do not stack or pack
tightly.

When heating pieogi, use large frying pan and saute (with butter,
salt pork or bacon in combination with onions or mushrooms) until
heated through. Serves 8 to 12. Serve with sour cream.

1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cup flour, or a little less (see note)
1 cup pine nuts, chopped
1  granulated sugar
1  sweetened milk, optional

CREAM BUTTER AND SUGAR together until very soft. Then carefully blend
in the ground almonds, salt, vanilla and flour. The dough will be
rather firm. Cut off pieces about the size of prunes and roll them
into little cigar-shaped pieces about 1/2-inch thick. Roll these in
the chopped pine nuts and bend them into a half-moon shape. Place
these 1-inch apart on greased baking pans. Bake at 350F for 15-to-20
minutes. The crescents should not be browned. Cool about 5 minutes,
then strew with a little granulated sugar or brush with heavily
sweetened milk.

NOTE: For reasons never adequately explained, cake and other baked
foods need more flour on some days than on others.

Pikelets (Bakestone Recipes)

breads, breakfast

8 oz plain or unbleached flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 oz fresh yeast*
1 teaspoon sugar
5 fl oz warm water
1 teaspoon butter
5 fl oz warm milk
1  egg, beaten

*Or 1 1/2 t dried yeast.  -- These are similar to crumpets -- they
are made with a yeast batter, but cooked without rings. -- Sift the
flour and salt into a warm bowl. Dissolve the yeast and the sugar in
the warm water. Melt the butter in the warm milk and beat in the egg.
Stir the yeast liquid and then the milk mixture into the flour. Mix
into a smooth batter and beat well. Cover and leave in a warm place
for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until the batter is thick and bubbling. Warm
the bakestone and grease with a piece of lard on a fork (use a piece
of fat back if you're short of lard). When a drop of water sputters
on the bakestone, it's hot enough. Stir the batter, then use a ladle
or a jug to pour it onto the bakestone in round "puddles|, leaving
space in between so that the pikelets will be easy to turn. The yeast
batter will not spread as much as pancake batter. Cook over a
moderate heat until bubbles break the top surface and the underneath
is pale gold.  Flip over the pikelets and cook the other side until
honey-colored.  Keep wach batch warm in a folded cloth in a low oven.
Serve with butter, honey or preserves, or for a savory dish, with
cream cheese or grilled bacon, or little sausages. To reheat, crisp
under the grill.

1/2 teaspoon ground marjoram
1/4 teaspoon ground thyme
1 cup milk
1/2 cup sharp cheddar cheese (1-1/2 oz)
1/4 cup pimiento, finely chopped
1 pkg dry yeast
2 tablespoon warm water (105 to 115 degrees)
3 3/4 cup all-purpose flour (3-1/4 to 3-3/4 c; ups)
1 tablespoon butter or margarine, melted

*DIRECTIONS*

Combine first 6 ingredients in a medium saucepan; gradually stir in
milk. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is
thickened and smooth. Remove from heat; add cheese and pimiento,
stirring until cheese melts. Cool mixture to lukewarm (105 to 115
degrees).

Dissolve yeast in warm water; add to cooled cheese mixture. Gradually
add 3 cups flour, beating at medium speed of an electric mixer until
dough is smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a stiff dough.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until smooth
and elastic (about 5 to 10 minutes). Place dough in a greased bowl,
turning to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85
degrees), free from drafts, 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk.

Punch dough down, and shape into a loaf. Place in a greased 9x5x3-inch
loafpan. Cover and let rise in a warm place, free from drafts, 1 hour
or until doubled in bulk.

Brush top with 1 tablespoon melted butter. Bake at 350 degrees for 35
to 40 minutes or until loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Remove loaf
from pan, and cool on a wire rack.

Yields 1 loaf.

Pineapple Upside-Down Loaf

8 oz pineapple rings, drained
4  maraschino cherries, halved
2 pkg coffee cake mix (10.5 ozs. each)
2  eggs
1 cup milk, divided

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Generously butter the bottom and sides
of an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch loaf pan. Cut pineapple rings in half. Place
4 pineapple-ring halves decoratively on the bottom of the prepared
pan, and the remaining 4 halves standing along the long side of the
pan. Place cherry halves, cut-side-down, in the center indentations
of the pineapple-halves. Sprinkle bottom and sides of the pan with 1
1/2 packets of the crumb mixture from coffee-cake mix. Discard
remaining crumb mixture. Prepare bags of coffee-cake mix with eggs as
package directs, but use the milk instead of water called for.
Squeeze batter from both bags gently over streusel, pineapple, and
cherries. Let stand 10 minutes. Tap pan gently on counter to release
any air bubbles. Bake 40 to 50 minutes, or until a wooden pick
inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool on a wire rack for
20 minutes. With a long, serrated knife, cut the top of the bread
level with the top of the pan. Invert bread onto a serving plate
while warm. To serve, cut with a sharp (not serrated) knife.

Piney Woods Hush Puppies

breads

2 1/2 cup yellow corn meal
1 teaspoon soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon granulated sugar
2 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1  egg, beaten
2 cup buttermilk
1 1/2 cup cooking oil (about)

Mix all dry ingredients; beat milk and egg together and combine with
dry ingredients; batter should hold its shape when picked up in
spoon. If it is too soft, add more cornmeal. Drop by molded
Tablespoon into 350"F fat and cook about 1 1/2 minutes; turn and cook
on second side 1 minute. Allow oil to heat a few seconds after
removing a batch. Delicious freshly cooked and hot; however, leftover
hush puppies freeze well. When ready to serve frozen hush puppies,
place on oven rack in preheated 250"F until very hot and crisp. Makes
about 48 hush puppies 2" round. Hints on frying: Using a small
diameter heavy saucepan allows using a minimum oil; a 5 or 6 inch pan
with oil 1 1/2 inches deep and heated to 350"F will cook three hush
puppies in about 2 1/2 minutes. When batter consistency is correct
and oil is at 350"F, hush puppies will become firm, round shapes
almost as soon as they enter the hot oil. If they are cooked in oil
that is too hot, they will not cook in the center. Serving
suggestions: Especially good served with fried catfish, trout,
shrimp, oysters, chicken or chicken-fried steak. Source: Texas

about 25 times. Turn off processor and let dough stand 1 to 2 minutes.

Turn on processor and gradually drizzle in enough remaining water to
make dough soft, smooth and satiny but not sticky. Process until
dough turns around bowl about 15 times.

Turn dough onto lightly greased surface.  Shape into ball and place in
lightly greased bowl, turning to grease all sides. Cover loosely with
plastic wrap and let stand in warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.

Punch down dough.  Shape into loaf and place in greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2
x 2 1/2 inch loaf pan.  Brush with oil. Let stand in warm place until
doubled, about 1 hour.

Heat oven to 400 F.  Bake until golden and loaf sounds hollow when
tapped, 25 - 30 minutes.

Remove immediately from pan.  Brush crust with oil, if desired. Cool
on wire rack.

Pissaladiere  La Menagere

breads, french, pastry

      ----CRUST----
5 oz plain flour
1 1/2 oz butter
1 each egg
1/2 oz salt
1  water
      ----FILLING----
1 1/4 lb onions; thinly sliced
2 each tomatoes; skinned and chopped
12 each anchovy fillets
12 small black olives; pitted
1  salt and pepper
1  olive oil

CRUST: Cut butter into small pieces and rub it into flour. Add a good
pinch of salt. Make a well in the centre; put in the egg and the
yeast dissolved in about 2 tablespoons tepid water. Mix and knead
until the dough comes away clean from the sides of the bowl. Shape
into a ball, make a deep cross-cut on the top, put on a floured
plate, cover with a floured cloth, and leave in a warm place to rise
for 2 hours. FILLING: Heat 3 or 4 tablespoons of olive oil in a heavy
fry-pan. Put in the onions and cook them very gently, with a cover on
the pan, until quite soft and a pale golden colour.  Add the tomatoes
and the seasonings (plus chopped garlic to taste, if desired) and
continue cooking until the onions and tomatoes have amalgamated, and
the moisture from the tomatoes has evaporated.

When the dough has risen; sprinkle it with flour and break it down
again. Knead once more into a ball and place in the centre of an
oiled 8-inch tart pan. Press the dough quickly but gently with your
knuckles outwards to the edge of the pan and up the rim.  Put in the
filling. Make a criss-cross lattice pattern with the anchovy fillets,
placing a halved olive in the centre of each opening in the lattice.
Leave it to rise for 15 minutes, then bake in the centre of an oven
preheated to 400 F for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 F and bake for
an additional 20 minutes.

Pizza

breads

2 cup tepid water
2 pkg instant yeast
4 tablespoon olive oil
5 1/2 cup flour
1/2 cup corn meal
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup salad oil

Mix this with 3 c flour for about 10 minutes. Then add rest of flour
and kneed 15 more minutes. Let dough rise once to double size. Punch
down. Then divide the dough in two (makes two pizzas). Spread out
dough flat. Oil the pan with olive oil and sprinkle with corn meal.
Spread the dough out in the pan and spread it around to cover the
entire bottom, then push it up the sides - like a pie crust.  If it
doesn't cover the whole pan push it around til it does. Let it rise
again. Put thin slices of mozzarella over the entire bottom of the
pizza. Squish and drain well one large can of skinned plum tomatoes,
and spread that over the cheese. Add a smidge of salt (I also add
ground black pepper). Chop or crush garlic over this (I use lots).
Basil and oregano sprinkled generously on top. Put on filing to taste
(I use sliced onions and spicy Italian sausage). Then sprinkle over
the top a combo of fresh grated Parma and Romano. Bake for 35 to 40
min at 475. Crust should be brown and crunchy. Hope you like it. I
usually make two at a time, with one having no meat on it for the
non-meat crowd (using zuccini peppers, mushrooms, onions). One pizza
is usually enough for 4 people with a salad. Hope you like it, David.

Pizza Crust-Bbs

breads

4 1/2 cup flour (high gluten recommended)
1 pkg dry yeast
1 teaspoon salt
2 cup warm water
2 tablespoon vegetable or olive oil

Mix 2 cups of the flour, the yeast and salt. Add the water and oil,
and mix thoroughly. Slowly add the remaining flour until the dough
can be worked by hand. Knead thoroughly. Allow to rise for 30 minutes.

After the rising time, roll out the dough to fit whatever pizza pan or
baking dish you prefer. Top as desired, then bake completed pizza for
12 to 14 minutes at 475 B0 F, testing for doneness after 10 minutes.

Additional note: Since I originally found this recipe, I've learned
that a pizza stone is by far the best way to bake a pizza at home.
Follow the directions that accompany the stone, but typically you
need to preheat both the oven and the stone (i.e., put the stone in
the oven in its final position while preheating the oven) for at
least 20 minutes before placing the pizza in the oven to bake. The
crust should come out just great!

Pizza Dough

breads

5 cup flour
2 pkg yeast (dry), active
2 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoon salt
2 cup water

Mix all of the dry ingredients first, then add the water.  It will appear
to be too dry. Do not add water. Keep working the dough until it is smooth.
(This requires a little faith but it really works). Let the dough rise once
(approx 1 hour). Punch it down and knead again.

At this point you may choose to freeze some of the dough.  If you do freeze
it, be sure to wrap it well and freeze it quickly.  With either fresh or
thawed dough, let the dough rise a second time.

After it has risen, punch it down and use it for your pizza.  The dough
will rise a little while you put the rest of your pizza toppings on it.
Then bake as appropriate for pizza thickness and toppings.

NOTES:

*  Simple pizza dough -- I don't remember where I learned this simple
recipe for pizza dough. It makes enough dough for two 12 x 18 pan pizzas. I
like it because it is so easy to memorize and it makes good pizzas. Of
course, it is not quite as easy to memorize in its metric rendering. Yield:
2    pizza crusts.

*  I have tried variations like whole wheat, and just about any flour
combination that works for bread works for pizza dough.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 2 hours rising.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.

Pizza Dough (Ew)

breads, main dish

1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 2/3 cup (to 2 c) unbleached or all- purpose; white flour
1 cup cake flour
1 teaspoon salt

In a measuring cup or small bowl, sprinkle yeast ovr 1/4 cup warm
water; stir until dissolved.  In a mixing bowl, combine 1 2/3 cups of
the unbleached or all-purpose flour, cake flour and salt. Make a well
in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the yeast mixture.
With a wooden spoon, gradually stir in the flour, adding 3/4 cup warm
watr as you mix. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface
and knead until very smooth, soft and no longer sticky, about 10
minutes, adding additional flour as needed to keep the dough from
sticking. (The dough should still be quite wet, however.)

Set the dough in an oiled bowl and turn to coat lightly. Cover with
plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.

About 10 minutes before baking pizza, turn the dough onto the floured
board, punch it down and knead briefly. Use a pastry cutter or a thin,
sharp knife to divide the dough in half. (If you pull the dough
apart, you risk tearing the gluten strands.)  Pat each half into a
ball and flatten into a disk.  Proceed as directed in any of the
following pizza recipes. (The dough can be made ahead, enclosed in a
plastic bag and stored in the refrigrator for up to 2 days or in the
freezer for up to 2 months. Defrost for at least 8 hours in the
refrigerator and bring to room temp. before using.)

Makes about 1 1/2 lbs. of dough, enough for two 12-inch pizzas.

Pizza Dough (Prodigy)

breads, pizza, italian

1 oz fresh yeast; -=or=-  instant dry yeast
1/2 cup milk; at room temperature
3/4 cup warm water (125f)
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cup unbleached white flour

IN A LARGE BOWL, dissolve the yeast in a mixture of the milk and
water. Mix in the flour and salt to make a soft dough. Knead 10
minutes by hand, or 4 minutes in a heavy-duty mixer with a dough
hook. Oil a clean bowl and set the dough in it, cover tightly with
plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled in bulk. (In the traditional
warm place, this will take about 2 hours. However, a cooler
temperature will do as long as the dough has enough time to rise,
including overnight in the refrigerator.) If the dough is ready
sooner than it is needed, punch it down and refrigerate it or let it
rise slowly again at room temperature until ready to use. When ready
to use, divide into 4 equal parts. Roll 1 into an 8-inch round. Top
with favorite toppings and bake 10 minutes in 450F oven.

Pizza Dough Martha Stewart

breads, pizza

1/2 cup warm water
1 pkg active dry yeast
2 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil

In a small bowl, combine 1/2 cup warm water and yeast. Let stand 10
minutes, or until creamy, then stir well.

Combine flour and salt in a food processor. Add yeast mixture and
olive oil and process just until the dough comes together.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 1 mintues.
Shape dough into a log and cut into 4 equal pieces. Flatten each piece
lightly with the palm of your hand to form a disc.

Place discs on a well-oiled cookie sheet and brush tops lightly with
olive oil. Cover discs with a large piece of plastic wrap and then
cover with a hot, damp cloth. Let stand in a warm place until dough
has douled in bulk, about 1 hour. Dough is now ready to be rolled
into a crust about 7 inches in diameter.

Pizza Dough~ & Variations

breads, main dish, italian

      ----STANDARD DOUGH----
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 cup warm water, 110-115 deg f
1/4 oz (1 envelope) active dry
1  yeast
3 1/4 cup bread, semolina, or unbleach
1  all-purpose flour, or a
1  combination
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup olive oil, preferrably
1  extra virgin
      ----WHOLE WHEAT----
1 tablespoon sugar or honey
1 1/4 cup warm water as above
1  envelope yeast
1 1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
2 cup whole-wheat flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup olive oil as above, or
1  vegetable oil
      ----CORNMEAL----
1 tablespoon sugar
1 cup warm water as above
1  envelope yeast
2 1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose or
1  semolina flour
1 cup yellow cornmeal or polenta
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup olive oil or vegetable oil
      ----NEW YORK----
1 cup warm water as above
1  envelope yeast
3 1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt

In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar or honey in warm tap water that is
110-115 deg F. (When making the New York Variation, omit the sugar and
proceed as follows). Sprinkle the yeast over the water and stir gently
until it dissolves, about 1 minute. Let stand in a warm spot until a
thin layer of foam covers the surface, about 5 minutes. Discard
mixture and start over if bubbles have not formed within 5 minutes.

If making whole-wheat dough, combine the 2 flours in a bowl and use
as the flour in the directions that follow.

If making the cornmeal dough, combine the flour and cornmeal in a
bowl and use the mixture as the flour in the directions that follow.

To mix and knead the dough by hand: Combine 3 cups of the flour with
the salt in a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the center of the
flour and pour in the yeast mixture and the oil, if using. Using a
wooden spoon, vigorously stir the flour into the well, beginning in
the center, and working toward the sides of the bowl, until the flour
is incorporated and the soft dough just begins to hold together.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Dust your hands
with flour and knead the dough gently in the following manner: press
down on the dough with the heels of your hands and push it away from
you, then partially fold it back over itself. Shift it a quarter turn
and repeat the procedure. While kneading, very gradually add just
enough of the remaining 1/4 c flour until the dough is no longer
sticky or tacky. This should take about 5 minutes. As you work, use a
metal dough scraper to pry up any bits of dough that stick to the
work surface. Continue kneading until the dough is smooth, elastic,
and springy. Too much kneading overdevelops the gluten in the flour
and results in a tough crust.

After mixing and kneading the dough, shape the dough into a ball and
place it in a well-oiled bowl, turning to coat completely on all
sides with oil. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap to prevent
moisture loss and set to rise in a draft-free warm place (75-85 deg
F) until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes for quick rising yeast to
1 - 1.5 hours for regular yeast.

With your fist, punch down the dough as soon as it has doubled in
bulk to prevent overrising. Shape it into a ball, pressing out all
the air bubbles. If you are using bread flour or semolina flour, turn
the dough in an oiled bowl to coat once more, cover again with
plastic wrap and refrigerate it until puffy, from 35 minutes to 1
hour. Omit this step if using all-purpose flour.

If you cannot bake pizza withing 2 hours after rising, punch the
dough down again, turn it in an oiled bowl to coat once more, cover
the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate. The dough can be
punched down a total of 4 times and kept refrigerated up to 36 hours
before the yeast is exhausted and the dough unusable. Let chilled
dough come to room temperature before proceeding.

Excerpted from the book, _Pizza_, by James McNair. Chapter includes
instructions on dough-making with a food processor and professional
mixing bowl.
