Asparagus Breadsticks

appetizers, breads

2  bread dough loaves*
1  large egg white
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon dried tarragon leaves
1 teaspoon dried dill weed

* - frozen white or whole wheat, thawed

Set loaves on a floured board and pat each loaf into a 5x10"
rectangle. Cover lightly with plastic wrap and let rinse until puffy,
45 minutes to 1 hour.

Cut each loaf crosswise into 9 equal pieces. Pick up the ends of each
piece, and stretch it to the length of a 12x15" greased baking sheet
and set on pan; if dough snaps back, let rest a few minutes, then
stretch again. Repeat to make each stick, spacing about 1 1/2" apart.

With scissors at a 45' angle, snip dough to make cuts about 1/2" apart
along about 4" of 1 end of each stick.

Beat egg white until slightly frothy; brush dough lightly with egg
white. Mix cheese, tarragon, and dill. Sprinkle evenly over dough.

Bake in a 350' oven until breadsticks are browned, 20-25 minutes. (If
using 1 oven, switch pan positions halfway through baking; chill
remaining pans of dough until oven is free.) Transfer breadsticks to
racks.

Serve warm or cool. If you make sticks ahead, let cool, package
airtight, and hold up to 4 hours, or freeze. To recrisp, bake
breadsticks (thawed, if frozen), uncovered, on pans in a 350' oven
until warm, about 5 minutes.

Ayalla's Banana Bread

breads, quick bread

3  bananas, very ripe
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup shortening (butter)
2  eggs
3 tablespoon yoghurt or sour cream
2 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup walnuts, chopped
1  rum, vanilla, or amaretto (optional; )

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream the shortening and sugar. Mix in
the bananas.  Mix in the remaining ingredients.  Pour into a greased loaf
pan. Bake 1 hour 15-20 minutes at 350 degrees F.

NOTES:

*  This recipe is from my friend Ayalla -- It makes a heavy, but moist,
loaf of banana bread.

*  If you use more than 3 normal-size bananas, I suggest that you lower the
oven temperature and cook for a while longer.  Otherwise, the crust comes
out almost overcooked while the middle remains moist and almost
undercooked.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  Preparation:  10 minutes; baking:  at least 95 minutes. Allow some
time for cooling.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

Baked Doughnuts

breads, desserts

2 pkg dry yeast
1/3 cup warm water
1 1/2 cup milk
1/3 cup vegetable shortening
1/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon nutmeg
2  eggs, lightly beaten
4 1/2 cup flour
1/2 cup melted butter
1 cup sugar mixed w/1 tsp cinamon

1. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in a small bowl and let it
dissolve for 5 minutes. Put the milk and shortening in a saucepan and
heat until the shortening is melted. Cool to lukewarm.

2. Pour the yeast mixture into a large mixing bowl and add the milk
mix. Stif in the 1/4 cup sugar, salt, nutmeg, eggs and 2 cups flour.
Beat briskly until well blended. Add the remaining 2 1/2 cups flour
and beat until smooth. Cover the bowl and let double in bulk, about 1
hour.

3. Dust a board generously with flour and turn the dough mass onto
it. This dough is soft and needs enough flour on the board to prevent
sticking, but is easy to handle. Pat the dough into a round about 1/2
inch thick. Use a 3 inch doughnut cutter and cut out the doughnuts,
placing them (and the doughnut holes) on greased baking sheets, 1
inch apart. These don't spread much; they rise. Preheat oven to 450F.
Let the doughnuts rest and rise for 20 minutes uncovered. Bake about
10 minutes or a little longer, until they have a touch of golden
brown. Remove from the oven. Have ready the melted butter and a
brush. On a sheet of wax paper, spread the cinnamon sugar. Brush each
doughnut and doughnut hole with butter and roll in the cinnamon
sugar. Serve hot.

Banana Flour

breads

6 ripe bananas

Slice and dry full grown bananas. Use only the fruit that is full
grown as green bananas contain too much starch. After drying, grind
or pound in a mortar, then pass the powder through a sieve. This
flour can be used in equal parts with regular flour in making
desserts where a starchy substance is used.

Bannock

breads, canadian

1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup rolled oats
2 tablespoon sugar, granulated
2 teaspoon baking powder salt
2 tablespoon butter, melted
1/3 cup raisins; optional water; approx,

"Bannock, a simple type of scone was cooked in pioneer days over open
fires. Variations in flours and the additional of dried or fresh
fruit make this bread the simple choice of Canadian campers even
today.  Oven baking has become an acceptable alternative to the cast
iron fry pan. McKelvie's restaurant in Halifax serves an oatmeal
version similar to this one. For plain bannock, omit rolled oats and
increase the all purpose flour to 1 cup.... One of the earliest quick
breads, bannock was as simple as flour, salt, a bit of fat (often
bacon grease) and water. In gold rush days, dough was mixed right in
the prospector's flour bag and cooked in a fry pan over an open fire.
Indians wrapped a similar dough around sticks driven into the ground
beside their camp fire, baking it along with freshly caught fish.
Today's native _Fried Bread_ is like bannock and cooked in a skillet.
Newfoundlander's _Damper Dogs_ are small rounds of dough cooked on
the stove's dampers while _Toutons_ are similar bits of dough deep
fried. At a promotional luncheon for the 1992 Inuit Circumpolar
Conference, Eskimo Doughnuts, deep fried rings of bannock dough, were
served. It is said that Inuit children prefer these "doughnuts" to
sweet cookies.
Red River settlers from Scotland made a frugal bannock with lots of
flour, little sugar and drippings or lard. Now this same bread plays a
prominent part in Winnipeg's own Folklorama Festival.
At Expo '86 in Vancouver, buffalo on bannock buns was a popular
item at the North West Territories ' restaurant. In many regions of
Canada, whole wheat flour or wheat germ replaces part of the flour
and cranberries or blueberries are sometimes added. A Saskatchewan
firm markets a bannock mix, and recipe books from coast to coast
upgrade bannock with butter, oatmeal, raisins, cornmeal and dried
fruit."

Stir together flours, oats, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add melted
butter, raisins (if using) and water, adding more water if needed to
make sticky dough. With floured hands, pat into greased pie plate.
Bake in 400F oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until browned and tester
comes out clean. Cut into wedges. SERVES:6 VARIATIONS: In place of
raisins add chopped dried apricots or fresh berries.(Blueberries are
terrific if one is camping in northern Ontario in August.)

Bara Brith ( Speckled Bread)

breads, ethnic

6 oz dried fruit
8 oz dark brown sugar
1/2 pint strong hot tea
10 oz self-raising flour
1  egg

This is Wales' traditional rich fruit bread.  South Wales makes it
with baking powder; Northerners prefer yeast as the raising agent.
Either way it's delicious.

Soak the dried fruit and sugar overnight in the tea. You can use
either fresh tea, or the cold dregs from the teapot (this gives a
good strong colour).  Next day, sieve the flour and fold it it into
the fruit. Mix in the lightly beaten egg.  Line a small loaf-tin with
buttered paper then tip in the mixture, smoothing it well into the
corners.

Bake in a gentle oven at 300 F (150 C) gas mark 2 for 1 1/2 hours.
Cool and store for at least 2 days in a tin so that it matures moist
and rich. Traditionalists say you should never butter the Bara Brith,
but Dorothy says do, as it's lovely that way.

Bara Brith (Currant Bread)  Welsh

breads

1/4 lb dried fruit
1 pint warm water
2 lb plain flour
6 oz lard
1/2 lb demerara sugar
4 oz candied peel
1/2 teaspoon mixed spice
2 teaspoon salt
1 oz fresh yeast
2 each eggs

Oven: 450F, Gas Mark 8 for 15 minutes: 375F, Gas Mark 5 for 45
minutes.

Soak the fruit and candied peel in the water with the spice.  Leave to
steep in a warm place and use the warm spicy, strained water to mix
the dough.

Sift the flour and salt and rub in the lard;  cream the yeast with the
sugar and a little of the spiced water;  mix this into the flour,
together with the eggs and use enough of the water to give a firm,
yet elastic dough.

Knead well, leave to rise and knock back;  blend in the drained fruit
and knead again.

Shape the dough into loaves and set into greased 1 lb tins in a warm
place to prove;  bake, reducing the temperature after the first 15
minutes.

Originally, in some recipies, the fruit content would have been fresh
currants or blackberries.

Bara Brith is often served as part of the traditional Welsh tea.  It
can also be purchased at many of the small bakeries found throughout
Wales.

slightly.  Combine eggs, cream, and honey with dry ingredients and mix
well.  Pour batter into muffin tin and bake at 400 F for 25 minutes
The same book says barley flour can be substituted for white flour
and make an all-barley bread.  So it seems one could substitute oats
for some of the barley in this recipe to make Barley/oats muffins.

bread, the word BARM meaning yeast.

derive from barm or leaven.  It is a corruption of the Irish word
"aran breac" (Speckled Bread).

Basic Bread Sponge

breads

1/4 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 1/2 cup water -- 105-115 degrees
4 cup all-purpose flour --
1  unbleached

Whisk the yeast into the water.  Allow to sit for about three
minutes. Add the flour, mixing for another three minutes. Place in a
nonreactive bowl and cover. Allow to sit in a draft-free spot until
it rises and gets thick and sticky.  This will take about eight hours.

Use a spoon to stir the sponge down before measuring for use in a
bread.

Once risen, refrigerate for up to three days.  Allow to come to room
temperature before using.  If it goes beyond three days, discard all
but 1 cup of the sponge and make the recipe, adding the reserved
sponge with the flour.  Stir for two or three minutes before using.

For all of the breads based upon this sponge, allow two days since the
doughs require overnight refrigeration.

For the best results, use as little of the kneading flour as possible.

To allow yourself to slide the loaves into the oven, form them on a
baking sheet without sides or on the bottom of one with sides that is
turned upside-down.

If you do not have a stone or tiles, bake directly on the baking
sheet(s) upon which you formed the loaves (be sure to use either
cornmeal or parchment between the dough and the sheet).

All of the breads based upon the sponge can be frozen for up to two
weeks. Don't freeze until the bread has cooled thoroughly - then wrap
in foil and freeze. When ready to use, thaw them, still wrapped, at
room temperature overnight.  Then, unwrap and warm at 350 degrees for
5 or 10 minutes. Alternatively, you could warm the frozen and wrapped
loaves at
300    for 35 to 40 minutes.

Basic Crumpet

breads

1 pkg active dry yeast
1 or 1 cake compressed yeast
1/4 cup water*
2 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon butter or margarine
1 cup milk, scalded
1  egg
3 cup all purpose flour

*Use very warm water (105-115 degrees for dry yeast, lukewarm (80-90
degree) for compressed yeast.

Sprinkle dry yeast or crumble cake yeast into water.  Let stand for a
few minutes; then stir until dissolved.  Add sugar, salt, and butter
to warm milk, stirring to dissolve; cool to lukewarm.  Add egg, yeast
mixture and flour and beat thoroughly.  Let batter rise in warm place
for 30 minutes; with spoon beat for 3 minutes.

Repeat rising and beating and then rising again.

Pour batter into greased 4 inch muffin rings on medium hot greased
griddle (325 degrees on electric griddle) filling rings one third
full.

Bake until well risen and browned on one side.  Turn over, rings and
all, and brown on other side (should take about 18 to 20 minutes)

Remove, cool, split, and toast.

Although crumpets are similar to English muffin, crumpets are softer
in texture with surface holes appearing during the pan cooking; these
holes enable the crumpet to absorb great quantities of butter.

Basic Muffins & Biscuits

breads

      ----BASIC BISCUIT BAKING MIX----
9 cup flour; sifted
1/3 cup baking powder; double acting
1 cup nonfat dry milk plus
2 tablespoon nonfat dry milk
4 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cup vegetable shortening

Stir baking powder, dry milk and salt into the sifted flour. Sift all
dry ingredients together until well mixed. Cut or mix fat into flour
mixture utnil all particles are thouroughly coated and mixture
esembels coarse cornmeal. Sotre mix in a jar or can with a tight lid.
It can be measured into 2 cup amounts and put in plastic bags or
jarsd where it will be ready for use. It may be stored at room
temperature for 6 weeks. Vary the liquids: dry milk solids are
already in the mix so more milk is not need. You can use fruit juice,
water or meat broth for the liquid called for in a recipe.

The recipes in this Pick-A-pocket book were written for commercial
packaged baking mix which has no milk so it is the liquid called for
in recipes. This mix is a perfect substitte. Just use water where it
calls for milk. (written out of my cookbook)

Basic biscuits: 2 cups mix, 1/2 cup water. Add water to mix and stir
20-25 times. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead 10-15
times. Roll to 1/2" thickness and cut with a knife to pockets shapes
or use biscuit cutter to make circles. Place in preheated sm and bake
5 minutes or until golden brown.

Sausage biscuits: 2 1/4 cups packaged biscuit baking mix(milk), 8
links sausages cooked.

Prepare biscuits according to package directions for rolled biscuits.
Knead dough, roll out on floured surface and cut 8 circles with a
biscuit cutter. Lay one sausage in center of each and wrap dough
around, pinching to seal. Sausages will stick out the ends. Bake 5
minutes or until golden brown.

Jelly biscuits: flatten unbaked biscuits with heel of your hand.
Place 1/2 teaspoon jelly or preserves in center. Fold over and pinch
edges together to seal. Bake 5 minutes or till golden.

Pimento cheese bread: 2 cups packaged biscuit baking mix, 1 egg,
beaten; 1/2 cup grated cheddar; 2/3 cup milk; 2 tablespoon drained
dice pimento (optional) Mix all ingredients together until soft dough
forms. Spoon into pockets.  Bake 10 minutes or until golden.

Basic Pita

breads, oriental

2 cup warm water
2 tablespoon yeast
1/2 teaspoon sugar
2 teaspoon salt
5 cup white flour

Pour water into a large bowl & add yeast.  Stir & add the sugar &
salt. Gradually add the flour, stirring constantly until the mixture
is smooth. Work in another 1/2 cup of flour with your hands, kneading
as you go, until the dough is no longer sticky.  Knead on a board for
another 5 minutes. Shape dough into a rectangle. Cut it in half,
lengthwise, & divide into 24 portions (or make 12 large pitas).
Shape each portion into a smooth ball & place each ball on a floured
surface. Cover with a damp cloth. Press each ball flat.  With a
rolling pin, roll each round from the centre out turning the dough
1/4 revolution each roll. A small pita should be 5 to 5 1/2" in
diameter & 1/4" thick. (Large ones should be 8" in diameter). Flip
pitas over & smooth out any creases. 15 minutes before loaves have
finished rising, preheat oven to 500F & warm an ungreased baking
sheet. As each loaf is rolled, place it on a floured surface, cover
with a dry clean towel & let rise for 30 to 45 minutes.  Place pitas
on the hot baking sheet. Bake on the bottom rack of the oven until
puffed & lightly browned on the bottom, about 4 minutes for small
ones & 3 1/2 for large ones. If desired, flip the pita over to brown
on the other side. Remove from oven, wrap in dry towels until cool
enough to handle. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Yield: 24 small pita

Basic Pizza Dough

breads, italian

4 1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose
1  white flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup olive oil
2 pkg dry yeast
1 1/2 cup warm water
2 teaspoon light brown sugar

Measure 1/2 cup warm water (110 F) into 2 cup container and stir in
the brown sugar.  (Make sure water is warm, not hot - too hot will
kill the yeast).  Dissolve the 2 packages of dried yeast in the water
and set it aside for 5 minutes.  Will become frothy. (about 2 cups
worth!)

Sift 4 cups of the flour and the salt into a large mixing bowl.  Make
a depression in the middle of the flour and pour in 3/4 of the olive
oil and 1 cup of warm water.  When the yeast is ready, add it also.

Dust your kneading surface with flour, then mix the ingredients in
the bowl with your hands.  Place dough ball on the floured surface
and knead from 8 to 10 minutes.  Add flour to the kneading surface if
the dough is too sticky or wet.  Eventually the dough will become
elastic.

Rub the insides of a clean bowl with the remaining olive oil and
place the dough in it, coating the dough with olive oil by turning it
in the bowl. Cover with a clean cloth and let rise in warm,
draft-free place until double in size, 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours.  An
oven with the light on or a lit burner pilot will provide suitable
heat for rising dough.

When dough has risen, divide into two halves, then roll each out on
floured surface.  A round shape may be cut out with table knife using
12" bowl or plate as template.

Sufficient for 2 12" thin-crust pizzas, or 1 12" thick-crust.

HINT: Before filling and baking, form rim around outer ring of pizza
dough to hold ingredients better.  Brush the inside area of the
dough, not the rim, with olive oil and let the dough sit in a warm
place and rise a little before filling.  Then spoon in sauce, cover
with 1 lb. mozzarella cheese, add meat toppings, then cover with
mozzarella/parmesan mixture of cheese. Then brush rim of pizza crust
with olive oil. Sprinkle the pizza pan or oven tiles with cornmeal to
prevent pizza from sticking to cooking surface!

THE VERY BEST:  Cook on a pizza stone or oven tile at 500 F.   The
unglazed oven tile makes a huge difference in the crispiness and
texture of the crust. It absorbs moisture and keeps oven temperatures
even. May even be removed with pizza and set on a rack on table -
will keep pizza warm much longer.

Basic Sourdough Bread**

breads

1 cup sourdough starter
2 1/2 cup flour
2 cup warm water
3 3/4 to 4-1/4 c flour
3 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
3 tablespoon vegetable oil

Cold water

Mix 1 st 3 ingreds. in 3 qt. glass bowl with wooden spoon until
smooth. Cover; let stand in warm, draft-free place for 8 hours. Add
3-3/4 C flour, sugar, salt, baking soda and oil to the mixture in
bowl. Stir with wooden spoon until smooth and flour is completely
absorbed. (Dough should be just firm enough to gather into a ball. If
necessary, add remaining 1/2 C flour gradually, stirring until all
flour is absorbed.) Turn dough onto heavily floured surface; knead
until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Place in greased bowl;
turn greased side up. Cover; let rise in warm place until double,
about 1-1/2 hours. (Dough is ready if indentation remains when
touched.) Punch dough down; divide into halves. Shape each half into
a round,  slightly flat loaf. Do not tear dough by pulling. Place
loaves in opposite corners of greased cookie sheet. Make three 1/4"
deep slashes in each loaf. Let rise until double, about 45 minutes.
Heat oven to 375. Brush loaves with cold water. Place cookie sheet in
center of oven; it should not touch the sides of the oven. Bake,
brushing occasionally with water, until loaves sound hollow when
tapped, about 50 minutes. Remove from cookie sheets; cool on wire
racks.

Be sure to let dough rise completely both times - it might take
longer than the estimated times given.

Basic Sourdough French Bread

breads

2 cup sourdough starter; proofed
1 pkg yeast; dry
6 cup flour, all-purpose
1 cup water; tepid
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt

combine starter, water, yeast, sugar, salt, and 1 cup of flour. Set
aside in warm place for about 15 minutes to proof. Add remaining
flour and knead dough until smooth and elastic. Cover with bowl and
allow to double (about 1 1/2 hours). Punch down dough and divide in
half. Shape dough into two baguettes by first rolling dough into a
large rectangle, then roll rectangle into loaf (tuck ends underneath
loaf), place on baking sheet and allow to double again. With a very
sharp knife, make a slit down each loaf. Bake in a pre-heated
375-degree oven for 30 minutes, Test for doneness by tapping on loaf;
it should sound hollow. For a crispy crust, periodically spray water,
with a hair sprayer, into the oven while loaves are baking. DARK RYE:
Substitute 3 cups of rye flour for 3 cups of the all purpose flour.
Add 2 tablespoons of caraway seeds to the batter, along with 1 cup of
dark molasses, and 2 tablespoons of powdered cocoa. Substitute brown
sugar for the plain sugar. Reduce water by 1/4 cup. RAISIN-CINNAMON:
Add 2 slightly beaten eggs to the batter, after proofing. Roll each
half of dough into a large rectangle. Sprinkle each rectangle with a
mixture of, 1/4 cup sugar and 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon.
Sprinkle each half with 1/2 cup of raisins. Carefully roll each
rectangle as you would to shape a baguette. tuck the ends underneath
the loaf. Allow to rise until doubled, do not split tops of loaves.
After baking brush loaves with melted butter. GARLIC-CHEESE: Add 1
cup of grated parmesan cheese to batter. Mince 6 cloves of garlic,
add to batter. After splitting tops of loaves, carefully pour 1
tablespoon of garlic butter on the top of each loaf. For a cheesier
loaf, before rolling rectangle into baguette, sprinkle with 1/2 cup
of grated cheddar cheese.

1/4 cup warm water
3/4 cup milk
1 cup flour *

Dissolve yeast in warm water in 3-qt glass bowl. Stir in milk. Stir in
flour gradually. Beat until smooht. Cover with towel; let stand in
warm, draft-free place until starter begins to ferment, about 24 hrs.
(bubbles will appear on surface of starter) If starter has not begun
fermentation after 24 hr, discard and begin again. If fermentation
has begun, stir well; cover tightly with plastic wrap and return to
warm, draft-free place. Let stand until foamy, 2-3 days. When starter
has become foamy, stir well; pour into 1-qt crock or glass jar with
tighlty fitting cover. Store in frig. Starter is ready to use when a
clear liquid has risen to top. Stir before using. Use 1 c starter in
recipe; reserve remaining starter. Add 3/4 c milk and 3/4 c flour to
reserved starter. Store covered at room temp until bubbles appear,
about 12 hrs, refrigerate. Use starter regularly, every week to 10
days. If the volume of the breads you bake begins to decrease,
dissolve 1 t yeast in 1/4 c warm water. Stir in 1/2 c milk, 3/4 c
flour and the remaining starter. *DO NOT USE SELF RISING FLOUR* NOTE:
Start bread at night to bake in the morning - or vice versa. Before
adding the milk and flour to remaining starter, bake your bread and
judge the volume

Basic Sourdough Starter (With Potato)

breads

1 large baking potato peeled, cubed
1 cup white flour
1/2 tablespoon active dry yeast
1 teaspoon sugar

Cook potato in water to cover until tender. Pour off liquid to
measure 1 c, saving potato for other use. Let potato water cook to
lukewarm. In a glass or ceramic bowl that has been scalded, place
flour, yeast and sugar; add lukewarm potato water and stir in well.
Cover with plastic wrap and pierce with fork to release gases. Place
in a warm, draft-free location at an even 85F for 2 days; stir
several times daily. (do not let sourdough starter rise above 95F
because higher temp are favorable to less desireable microorganisms)
Refrigerate until ready to use. Replenish with one c flour and 3/4 c
water and let stand overnight or 12 hrs in a warm location before
refrigerating again. When replenishing, add lukewarm water with
flour. Starter should be at room temp when using in recipes, always
after having stood 12 hrs from addition of replenishing flour and
water. At least 1 c should remain to refrigerate.

Basic Sourdough Starter From Katherine Smith

breads

1 pkg active dry yeast
1 quart lukewarm water
2 tablespoon sugar
4 cup flour; sifted

In a large crock, holding at least 3 quarts, add yeast mixed with
water. Add sugar and flour, beat to mix. Cover, let rise until light

BASIC WHITE BREAD BY JAMES BEARD~ CHEF & COOK

breads

1 pkg yeast; active, dry
1/4 cup water; warm (110-115 degs)
2 teaspoon sugar
1 cup milk
3 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon butter
3 3/4 cup flour; all-purpose
      ----EGG WASH----
1 medium egg white; beaten slightly in 1 tbs

James Beard's Basic White Bread Makes 1 large loaf or 2 small loaves *
Making basic white bread dough * In a small bowl mix the yeast and
the 1/4 cup warm water; add the sugar, stir well, and set aside until
proofed. It is proofed when fermentation is apparent: the mixture
will swell and small bubbles appear on the surface. (If it doesn't
proof at all, it means the yeast is not fresh.) In a small saucepan
heat the milk with the salt and stir in the butter until it melts.
Set aside to cool until it is no warmer than the yeast mixture. Put 2
cups of the flour in a large mixing bowl and stir in the milk
mixture. Beat well with a wooden spatula, add the yeast mixture, and
continue beating the dough until it is smooth, adding an additional
cup of flour to make a firm dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured
work surface and begin the kneading process, which evenly distributes
the fermenting yeast cells through the dough. * Kneading Instructions
* There are several kneading methods, but the basic one is to flour
the dough and your hand lightly, then push the heel of your hand down
into the dough and away from you. Fold the dough over, give it a
quarter turn, and push down again. Repeat pushing, folding and
turning until the motion becomes rhythmic. Knead for about 10
minutes, kneading in additional flour as necessary, until the dough
is smooth and no longer sticky, and blisters form on the surface. To
test whether the dough has been kneaded enough make an indention in
it with your fingers; it should spring back. If blisters form on the
surface of the dough and break, this is another sign that the
kneading is sufficient. * Note: If you have a heavy-duty electric
mixer with a dough-hook attachment, knead the dough with the hook and
finish it off on the board. Butter a large bowl, transfer the dough
to it, and turn the bowl until the dough is well coated with butter
on all sides. Cover the dough with a dish towel and let it rise in a
warm, draft-free place for 1 to 1-1/2 hours, until it is doubled in
bulk. A good, warm, draft-free place is inside your room temperature
oven. To test further if the dough has risen properly, make an
indentation in it with two fingers: if the dough does not spring
back, then it is ready. * Baking Preparations * Butter a 9x5x3 inch
loaf pan, or two pans that are about 8x4x2 inches. Punch the dough
down with your fist to deflate it; transfer it to a floured board and
knead it well for about 3 minutes. Pat it into a smooth round or oval
shape and let it rest for 4 to 5 minutes. Then form into 1 large or
two small loaves, by shaping the dough into an oval the length of
your bread pan, then gently stretching, rounding, and plumping it in
the palms of your hands, tucking the edges underneath and pinching
them together. Lift carefully; drop the dough into the pan or pans
and smooth out. Cover the dough with a towel and let it rise again in
a warm draft-free place for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, until it is
double in bulk. Preheat the oven to 400dF.  Brush the egg wash over
the top of the dough. Bake in the center of the oven for 20 minutes;
reduce the heat to 350dF and bake for 20 to 25 minutes longer, until
the crust is well browned and the bread sounds hollow when removed
from the pan and tapped on the bottom with the knuckles. If you like
a crusty loaf, remove it from the pan about 5 to 10 minutes before
the end of the baking time and let it finish baking on the oven rack.
It will get brown and crusty all over. Remove the bread from the oven
and let it cool on a rack before slicing. The bread may be stored in
a plastic bag in the refrigerator after it has cooled. If you seal it
in a bag before it is completely cooled, the crust will become soft.
Stored bread will keep about 1 week. It also freezes well if wrapped
tightly in plastic wrap and sealed in a plastic bag and can be kept
for up to
3    months.

Basil-Parmesan Scones

appetizers, breads

1 recipe buttermilk bisquits
1/2 cup parmesan
1 tablespoon basil
1 dash garlic & onion
1  powder, black pepper

There's a bakery near me called Aunt Mary's (are you listening,
Sallie?) and they have the most wonderful basil-parmesan scones. One
day I experimented and was pleased to find a pretty good facsimile.

Just add the above ingredients along with all the other dry
ingredients and proceed as above.  These are a nice change of pace
from Italian or garlic bread. Or cut with smaller cutter and serve as
appetizer (don't forget to reduce baking time if smaller).

breads, cajun

6 cup all purpose flour (soft)
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup shortening
1 cup milk

Mix the flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder in a bowl or in a food
processor fitted with a metal blade.
Add the shortening and cut in or process until the mixture is the
consistency of coarse meal.  Pour in the milk and stir or process just
until the dough holds together. If it is dry or crumbly, add more
milk. If it is too wet, add more flour.  Knead briefly in the food
processor, then turn out onto a floured board or beat 1,001 times
with a rolling pin.
when it's ready, the dough should "snap" when you hit it. Fold the
dough in half.    Roll out the folded dough until it is 1/2 inch
thick. Cut with a 1-1/4-inch biscuit cutter into small rounds. Prick
each round with a fork, making two parallel sets of holes in the
biscuit. keep rolling out the dough, folding before cutting, until
all the scraps are gone and you have made about 100 biscuits.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Place the biscuits on a lightly
greased pan.  Bake for 30 minutes, until crisp, but not browned. They
should open easily when split with a fork. They will keep for weeks
tightly covered in a tin or in the freezer.
Split in two before serving. From Nathalie Dupree's "New Southern
Cooking"

Beignets With Chocolate & Apricot Sauce

breads

3/4 cup ; water
6 tablespoon butter, unsalted; cut into slices
1 tablespoon sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup flour, sifted
3 large egg; room temperature
1  oil, for shallow frying
1  sugar, powdered; (garnish)
      ----BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE SAUCE----
4 oz chocolate, semi-sweet
1 oz chocolate, unsweetened
1/2 cup ; water
2 1/2 tablespoon butter, unsalted
1/2 cup sugar, powdered
      ----APRICOT SAUCE----
1 cup apricot preserves
3 tablespoon apricot brandy; or water

Pour the water into a small, heavy saucepan, and add the butter,
granu- lated sugar, and salt.  Bring to a rolling boil, at which time
the butter should be melted. Add the flour all at once. Lower the
heat, and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, for a minute
or two, until the mixture comes away from the sides of the pan.

Remove the pan from the heat, and beat in the eggs, one at a time,
incorporating each egg thoroughly before adding the next. Continue
beating until thick and smooth. Allow the mixture to cool while
heating the oil.

Pour enough vegtable oil in a large skillet so that it is at least 1
inch deep.  Heat to 360 degrees.

Drop the mixture by heaping teaspoonfuls into the hot oil, frying
only a few beignets at one time so that they are not crowded. Fry for
about 4 to 5 minutes, or until they are crusty and a dark golden
brown, turning occasionally with a spoon so that they color evenly.

Note:  It is important that the fritters are crusty, if undercooked,
they will deflate before being served.
Using a 10-inch skillet, you should be able to fry 10 fritters at a
time (one-third the mixture).

When they are sufficiently cooked, remove the fritters with a slotted
spoon, and drain on paper toweling. Place successive batches in a 250
degree oven to keep hot while frying the remainder.

Place the beignets on a heated serving platter, and dust the tops
generously with confectioner's sugar put through a wire sieve. Pass
the sauces separately.

Chocolate sauce:  Chop the chocolates into coarse pieces and place in
the top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water. Add the
water, butter and sugar. Stir occasionally until the chocolate is
melted and the mixture is well blended and smooth. Remove from the
heat, but keep the sauce over hot water until ready to serve. It
should be served warm.

Apricot sauce:  Turn the apricot preserves into a small saucepan. Add
3 tablespoons of the brandy or water, and simmer, stirring, just until
thoroughly heated. Add additional liquid, if necessary, to bring to a
sauce consistency. Serve Warm. Note:  if there are any large pieces
of fruit in the preserves, break them up while heating. Submitted By

Beinets Or French Fritters

breads, brunch

1 tablespoon butter
6 tablespoon all-purpose flour
4  eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 confectioner's sugar

These are as light as air.  Heat deep fat to 370 degrees. Combine
water, butter and flour in a saucepan and boil (stirring constantly)
over low heat for about 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat and beat in
one at a time, the eggs.  Beat the batter for about 3 minutes AFTER
each egg. Add the vanilla and drop the batter from a teaspoon into
the hot fat. Cook until golden, drain and dust with the
confectioner's sugar To be good these must be delicate in flavor,
therefore the frying fat must be impeccable. If you fry in the usual
bland cooking oil, heat it to 365-70 degrees and cook the batter
until almost golden. If you use butter or part butter for frying,
start frying with the fat at 330 degrees and let the heat rise over a
7 minute period to 360. Be sure to bring the heat of the fat DOWN to
330 again between cookings.

Best Cranberry Muffins

breads

1/4 cup butter
1 1/2 cup unsifted flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup sugar
1 large egg
1/2 cup milk
1 cup fresh cranberries
2 tablespoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

Stir flour to aerate.  Mix the 2 tablespoons sugar with cinnamon.
Coarsely chop cranberries with knife.

Generously butter a 12 cup muffin pan.

In a small saucepan or skillet, melt butter; set aside to cool.

In a medium mixing bowl, with a fork, thoroughly stir together the
flour, baking powder, salt and sugar.

In a small mixing bowl beat egg enough to combine yolk and white;
beat in milk and melted butter.  Add to flour mixture; stir quickly
and lightly just until flour is almost dampened. Add cranberries;
lightly stir in; do not beat.

Using a large metal spoon, spoon batter into prepared muffin-pan
cups, filling each slightly more than half full. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon
cinnamon-sugar over batter in each cup.

Bake in a preheated 375~ oven until golden brown and a cake tester
inserted in the center comes out clean - 20 to 25 minutes.

If muffins are to be held 10 to 15 minutes before serving, tip them
in the pan to prevent steaming and keep in a warm oven. To reheat
cold muffins, place them in a covered pan or a closed paper bag in a
preheated 350~ oven for 10 minutes.

breads

3 cup sifted enriched flour
3/4 cup sugar
3 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1  egg, beaten
1 1/2 cup milk
2 tablespoon salad oil
3/4 cup california walnuts, broken

Stir the dry ingredients together. Combine egg, milk, and salad oil;
add to dry ingredients, mixing well. Stir in nuts. Turn into greased
9 1/2 X 5 X 3-inch loaf pan. Bake at 350F about an hour. Remove from
pan; cool.

NOTE: I usually put in 1 c nuts. Don't over mix because it won't
rise, and becomes a hard brick.

It's especially good with Cream cheese spread on it.

BEST: BISCUIT MIX

biscuits, mix

9 cup cake-and-pastry flour
1 cup skim milk powder
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup baking powder
1 tablespoon salt
2 teaspoon baking soda
1 lb shortening

In large bowl, stir together flour, milk powder, sugar, baking
powder, salt and baking soda. Using pastry blender, cut in shortening
until mixture is in fine crumbs. Transfer to airtight container;
store in refrigerator for up to 2 months.

Stir well before using.

[Crisco Golden variety shortening adds colour and flavour.]

See "Best: Golden Tea Biscuit" for use of mix.

Biscuit Tips:

1. When measuring large quantities of dry ingredients, measure each
into separate bowl; that way, if you lose count, you can recheck
measure before mixing ingredients.

2. Always pour liquid ingredients over the entire surface of the dry
ingredients, meanwhile tossing lightly with fork to incorporate dry
ingredients into wet without overworking the flour.

3. Dip cutter into flour between cutting each biscuit to prevent
dough from sticking to cutter.

4. Any scraps left over after cutting dough can be sprinkled with
sugar, then baked. Or, to avoid wastage, pat dough into a square,
then cut into squares instead of rounds.

5. Because biscuits are rich in fat, you don't need to grease the
baking sheet. You can leave the sheet ungreased or sprinkle baking
sheet lightly with all-purpose flour.

6. To ensure even browning and baking, make each biscuit the same
size and shape.

7. To remove sticky batter from bowl and fork, first rinse with cold
water before washing in hot soapy water.

Stir the yeast into the warm water in a large bowl & let proof for 10
minutes.  Add the rest of the water & the flour 1 c at a time, mixing
vigorously after each addition. Continue to mix for about 6 minutes.
The mixture will clear the sides of the bowl but remain soft &
sticky. Cover with plastic wrap & leave to rise at room temperature
for 24 hours. The starter will triple in volume & then collapse a
little. Cover & refrigerate until ready to use. To use the biga,
scoop out the needed amount while it is still cold & hasn't begun to
grow & expand at room temperature. NOTE: Ensure that you use golden
durum flour & not durum integrale which contains the whole husk of
the wheat berry & is not right for this recipe.

Bimini Bread

breads, side dish

2 pkg dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water
1/2 cup nonfat dry milk powder
2/3 cup sugar, granulated
1/2 cup oil, vegetable
1 teaspoon salt
2  eggs
1 1/3 cup warm water
7 1/2 cup flour, all-purpose, as neede

Soften yeast in 1/2 cup warm water for 10 minutes. Using a large food
processor, electric mixer or wooden spoon, beat yeast mixture, dry
milk powder, sugar, oil, salt and eggs until smooth. Add 1 1/3 cups
warm water and 2 cups of the flour; beat until smooth.  Add remaining
flour, a little at a time, beating well after each addition. Stop
adding flour when a stiff dough is formed.  Without a heavy-duty
mixer or food processor, you will need to work in the last of the
flour with your hands. With dough hook or by hand on a lightly
floured surface, knead until dough is smooth and elastic.  Place in a
greased bowl and turn to grease top. Cover and let rise until double
in bulk, about 2 1/2 hours. Punch dough down and fold over edges,
pressing until air bubbles are pushed out. Divide dough into 4
pieced.  form each piece into a loaf or ball. Place in greased 8x4
inch loaf pans or 8-inch round cake pans. Cover and allow to rise
until double in size, about 1 hour.  Bake in a preheated 350 oven for
40 minutes or until nicely browned and done. Remove from pans and
cool on wire racks. Freeze extra loaves for futureuse.

Biscochitos- A Cut Out Sugar Cookie

biscuits

1 cup sugar
1 cup margarine or butter
3 tablespoon sweet sherry
1  egg
3 cup flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoon anise seed crushed
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Mix sugar and margarine, sherry and egg in a
large bowl. Stir in the remaining ingredients except the 1/4 cup
sugar and the cinnamon. Divide dough into two balls. Roll out each
ball to 1/4 inch thick and cut into any shape with cookie cutters.
Place on ungreased sheet. Mix together the sugar and cinnamon and
sprinkle on the cookies before baking. Bake 10-12 minutes until
golden.

These cookies are cute made into a cactus shape. Pinch off balls of
dough, one larger than a quarter and 2 the size of a nickel. Roll
each of the balls between your palms to make cigar shape. Flatten the
large one to make the main stem of the cactus. Bend one third of each
of the two smaller ones to make a J shape and attach them at uneven
intervals on each side to make the "arms". Flatten them to match the
trunk and bake.

Let you daughter taste the anise first.  Often children do not like
it as much as adults.  If your daughter does not like the anise
flavor simply substitute cinnamon oil or flavoring.  It is very
popular in Mexico.

Biscotti - The Dipping Cookie

biscuits, italian

1/4 cup hazelnuts
1/2 cup almonds
1 zest of 1/4 lemon
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup dark brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 tablespoon melted margarine
2 eggs (or equiv. eg 
2 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 egg white

The "Bis" means twice and "Cotti" means cooked --- and our recipe for
these crisp, cruncy cookies does just that. They are best when dipped
in hot coffee, cocoa or milk for a few seconds until softened, then
eaten right away.

Preheat oven to 400^.  Toast nuts until browned, about
8    minutes; let cool.

Use metal blade in food processor work bowl to finely chop zest and
granulated sugar, about 60 seconds.  Add brown sugar, extracts,
margarine and eggs; process until combined, about 5 seconds. Add nuts
and dry ingredients and pulse until combined, about 12 times.

Transfer dough to floured surface; roll into two 12" logs. Pat logs
to 2 1/2" wide.  Place 3" apart on lightly greased baking sheets.
Beat egg white slightly and brush over surface of logs. Bake 20
minutes until firm and lightly browned.  Remove from oven; reduce
heat to 325^. While still warm, cut logs diagonally into 1/2" slices,
lay cut side down on sheets. Bake 15 minutes more until dry. Cool on
whire racks.

Store in plastic food storage bag or tin for up to 1 month.

Biscotti Di Pratto

breads, italian

1/4 cup almonds, blanched
3/4 cup almonds, whole unblanched
4  eggs, divided
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
2 1/4 cup flour
1 cup sugar, white
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch salt

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. On a baking sheet, roast blanched and
unblanched almonds until blanched almonds start to brown, shaking pan
occasionally; 5 to 8 minutes. Remove blanched almonds, place in
blender container and grind until it turns to powder. Set aside.
Meanwhile, return whole almonds to oven 2 to 3 minutes longer. Remove
and chop whole almonds roughly with knife, leaving large chunks. Set
aside. Turn oven down to 300 degrees. Grease baking sheet & dust with
flour; set aside. In a small bowl, beat 3 eggs, vanilla & extract. In
large bowl, mix together flour, sugar, baking soda, salt and ground
almonds. Make a well in the center and add the eggs, blending to
gradually incor- porate all of flour mixture. You should have a stiff
dough. If it is too stiff to hold together, add a little water.  Add
the crushed almonds and knead them evenly into the dough. Divide
dough into 3 portions. Form each into a long log, rounded or slightly
oval (about 1 1/2 inches in dia- meter). It will flatten as it bakes.
Place on prepared baking sheet. Bake 45 - 50 minutes. Remove from
oven and let rest 5 minutes. Turn oven down to 275 degrees. With a
serrated knife, cut logs into 3/4" slices. (NOTE: Unlike slicing a
loaf of bread, straight across its width, cut biscotti on a 45 degree
angle.) Lay slices flat on 2 baking sheets. Return to oven for 20 -
25 minutes, turning slices 1/2 way through baking time. Remove from
oven; allow to cool completely before sealing in containers. They
will stay fresh up to 1 month.

Biscuit Bonanza

breads

      ----  ~BISCUIT BONANZA In----

France, dessert is often constructed from towers of flaky puff
pastry, and in the Middle East, paper-thin phyllo dough is either
left crispy or made soggy with syrup. But the U.S. has biscuits to
call its own. Biscuits--moist, tender and rich--are used as an
alternative to a yeast-leavened bread. Biscuits are closer in
technique to making pie crust than to making bread. The steps follow
the same order: Cut the shortening into the flour mixture, add some
liquid and roll it out. Once you've mastered the technique, you can
not only delight in the aroma of biscuits browning for breakfast, you
can also bake scones for a proper English tea. (The difference is
there are eggs in scones and not in biscuits). Biscuits are similar
to real shortcakes, rather than the hockey pucks made from cellulose
sponges found next to the red glop in the produce department. And you
can crown fresh fruit with a biscuit dough topping and call it a
cobbler. Start by sifting the dry ingredients ~-flour, baking powder
or soda, salt, sugar and so forth. Then cut in the butter or
shortening until the mixture resembles a fine meal, like breadcrumbs.
While a wire-blade pastry blender is useful, you can use two knives,
pulse a food processor fitted with the steel blade on and off a few
times, or use your fingertips. The third step is adding the liquid.
The trick is to accomplish this quickly, so that the ingredients are
just blended enough to hold together. It's tempting to do more, but
that's what makes biscuits or their first cousins tough. Once liquid
is added to flour the gluten formation begins, and any agitation
intensifies this process. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured
surface, such as a counter or a pastry board, and use the same
restraint that went into adding the liquid. Don't knead it more than
10 times, just enough to give it a push in the oven, but not enough
to make it chewy. Now either roll or pat the dough into the proper
thickness. The dough should be less than 1 in thick. Cut it into
desired shapes. No fancy cutters? Use juice cans (a 2 in diameter) or
an upside down glass.

Biscuits

biscuits

2 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 cup plus 2 tbs shortening
1 cup buttermilk
1/2 teaspoon baking soda

Mix the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a medium
bowl. Cut in the shortening with a pastry blender or a
fork until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.  Stir the
baking soda into the buttermilk, and allow to sit for two
or three minutes.  Stir the buttermilk into the flour
mixture (with a spoon, not a mixer). The dough should be
very wet.

Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface.  Knead
two or three times to get the lumps out.  The dough will
be very sticky, but be very careful not to knead in too
much flour.

Pat the dough out to about 1/2 inch thick.  Cut with
biscuit cutter or small round cookie cutter (I use an old
8 oz tomato sauce can with both ends cut out) and arrange
on a greased cookie sheet.  Bake at 450 degrees for 10 to
12 minutes, or until the biscuits are lightly browned.

Serve immediately with lots of butter and molasses! From The Cookie

Biscuits Supreme

biscuits

2 cup flour
4 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup shortening
2/3 cup milk

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Stir together the flour, baking powder,
sugar, cream of tartar and salt. Cut in the shortening until the mixture
resembles coarse crumbs.

Make a well in the center.  Pour in the milk all at once.  Stir just until
dough clings together; NO MORE.

Knead gently on a lightly floured surface for 10-12 strokes.  Roll or pat
to about 1/2-inch thickness. Cut with a (about) 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter,
dipping the cutter into flour before each cut.

Transfer to an ungreased baking sheet.  Bake in a 450 degrees F oven for
10-12 minutes, or until golden.

Lots of cookbooks tell you to use two knives, or some such, to do the
cutting-in of the first step.  Forks work fine for me (I'm a klutz.)

All of the trick to making light, fluffy biscuits is in how you handle
them: THE LESS, THE BETTER. You can make these as drop biscuits (skip the
rolling; drop batter by tablespoons, and bake); they're even better for the
lack of handling.

Outside North America you might not know what shortening is.  Use butter,
margarine, copha or lard.  Vegetable shortening really is better for this
recipe, but don't forget lots of butter to put *on* them.... I make these
for study breaks. They disappear at an exponential rate....

NOTES:

*  Simple, fluffy biscuits -- This originated in "The Better Homes and
Gardens Cookbook," which I consider basic equipment for genteel
middle-class living. Here "biscuits" is the North American meaning of the
word and not the Commonwealth meaning of the word. In England these would
be called "scones." Yield: makes 10-12.

Blintzas

breads, cheese/eggs

      ----BLETLACH: (CREPES----
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cup flour
1 cup water
3  egg
      ----FILLING----
1 lb cottage cheese
1 egg yolk
1 tablespoon sugar

Sift  flour  and salt.   Beat eggs well, add water. Add flour
gradually to eggs, stirring constantly, until batter is smooth and
thin. Heat a small frying pan, Teflon makes life easy, and smear with
a very thin coat of butter.  When pan is hot, put in about 1/4 cup
batter, tilt pan until it covers.  Cook until it begins to blister
and is shiny. Turn out on table cloth. I always use one, but I Guess
you can use paper towels. Continue until all the batter is used.
Should make 10 or 12 circles. Mix the ingredients well. Now it's time
to 'build your blintzas' as my daughter used to say. Put some filling
off center on each circle. Fold the bottom up and the top down.  Tuck
in sides, or fold in, before you put the op down. Confused? Just try
it, it's easy. At this point you can store them in the fridge,  or
freeze them.  They freeze well. To finish, just fry them in a small
amount of butter, until browned Great, served with sour cream. They
are a bit complicated, but not really difficult. Howard, I am giving
you the recipe for 24 because it is so easy and they freeze so well.
Use well seasoned pans, 6". This should make about 50 pancakes. I
guess the directions don't change when you change the ammounts.

Bobalky

breads, ethnic

1 tablespoon butter
1 pkg yeast
2 tablespoon sugar
1/4 cup water, lukewarm
2 1/2 teaspoon salt
7 cup flour, all purpose, sifted
2 cup milk, scalded

Into a mixing bowl, place butter, sugar, and salt. Add scalded milk;
let cool until lukewarm. Add yeast dissolved in water. Add enough
flour to make a soft elastic dough. Turn onto a floured board and
knead. Place in a greased bowl and let rise until double in bulk (1
to 1 1/2 hours) in a warm place, free from drafts. Punch dough down
with fingertips and let rise again (about 45 minutes). Toss lightly
on floured board, knead, and shape into a roll (like a pipe) about
1/2 inch in diameter. Place on cookie sheet. Cut with edge of
teaspoon into small pieces and let rise for 10 minutes. Bake at 375-F
for 15 minutes or until lightly brown. When cool, break and place in
collander. Pour boiling water over bobalky. Place on serving dish,
mix with poppy seed and melted butter, and serve.
Poppy seed (1/2 cup) should be ground and cooked in 3/4 cup
water for 10 minutes. Boil 3 cups milk and 1 cup sugar and mix with
poppy seed.
Instead of using sugar in poppy seed mixture, honey may be used,
poured over the bobalky.
If your family is small, divide the above dough into two
portions, bake bobalky from one portion, and a loaf of bread from the
other.

Boboli Crust

breads, main dish, ethnic, boboli, crusts

      ----ED BOSMAN MKPN54A----
2 1/2 cup bread flour salt
3/4 teaspoon active dry yeast warm water
2 small cloves garlic; thinly sliced
2 tablespoon rosemary*
3 tablespoon bertolli light olive oil

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Combine flour, salt, yeast and water in
bowl. Blend well, turn out onto floured surface. Knead well, about 15
minutes. Place in lightly greased bowl, not buttered, cover with a
damp cloth and let rise for 1-1/2 hours (until doubled in bulk). Turn
dough out, punch down and knead for 5 minutes or so. Return to bowl
and let rise until doubled in bulk.  Punch down and turn out on
lightly floured board. Roll and press out to about 1/2 inch
thickness. This recipe makes about 1-12 inchers-so you can judge
whether to double or reduce the recipe. Rub surface of baking
(cookie) sheet with oil and transfer the dough round to the sheet.
Make several indentations with the point of a knife in the dough and
insert garlic slices and rosemary into indentations.Rub olive oil
(pour) onto surface and gently smooth over the surface. Salt and
pepper surface LIGHTLY.  Bake 10-12 minutes or until just golden.
Remove from oven and TAKE OUT THE GARLIC SLIVERS! You can now top the
crust, freeze it, eat it the way it is, smille at it (YOU DID IT!)
Remember, when you top it the crust is alread 2/3 baked and will
require only enough time so that the cheeses, etc. are bubbly.

Bob's Buffet Biscuits

biscuits

40 oz biscuit mix (e.g. 1 box of bisquick; )
3/4 cup parmesan cheese, grated
1/3 cup green onions, chopped
2  eggs, slightly beaten
2 cup milk

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a big bowl mix the biscuit mix, onions,
eggs, milk and about 1/2 cup of the cheese.

Put the dough into a  9x13 inch baking pan and smooth it down.  You will
have to flour your hand or spatula to do this. Sprinkle the rest of the
cheese over the top and then use the spatula or knife to score the dough
into square biscuits. Cut all the way to the pan.

Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees F. for 40 to 45 minutes. When they
are done a wooden toothpick stuck into the dough will come out clean.

NOTES:

*  Some not-so-plain biscuits -- This recipe is from Bob Clover of
Sausalito, California and was first published in _Sunset_ magazine. Yield:
24-30 biscuits.

*  When you take them out of the oven, flip the pan upside down over a rack
to get the biscuits out, then flip the rack over to get everything back
right side up again.

*  This is good if you are having a lot of company or want a lot of
leftovers.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

Bran Muffin Mix

breads, cakes

1 cup unprocessed coarse bran
2 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar (or more to taste)
2 tablespoon baking powder
2 teaspoon salt

Whisk all ingredients together in lge. bowl--mix thoroughly. Measure
2 cups into each of 2 plastic bags. Divide any remaining mix equally.

This mix does not produce a sweet cake-like muffin. Rather full
bodied and textured.  This produces nice contrast when heaped with
orange marmalade.

However, feel free to adjust sugar to taste.  These recipes are meant
to serve only as guidelines.  Tinker with them to your hearts'
delight. They are all "cook-friendly", for the exception of any yeast
raised mixes, which must be handled like one would approach a prima
donna: with respect. Yeast breads are quite tempermental.

Bread Dumplings (Sourdough)

breads, side dish

2 cup sourdough batter; proofed
1 cup milk
3 large eggs
6 cup flour, all-purpose
2 tablespoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
6 toast slices; cut in cubes

Recipe by: Randy Pollak In a very large mixing bowl combine flour,
baking powder, salt and toast cubes; mix well. In a medium bowl beat
eggs slightly; add sourdough batter and milk. Stir until well
combined. Pour batter mixture into flour mixture and mix dough until
smooth. Divide dough into four equal pieces and shape each piece into
small rectangular loaves. Set on wax paper, cover with plastic wrap
and then a dish towel. Allow dough to rest for at least 1 hour.
Prepare a large Dutch oven by placing a vegetable steamer inside and
add water until it comes to just below the steamer. Cover and bring
to boil. Reduce heat but it must be high enough to create steam.
Place 1 or 2 (depending on size as loaves will better than double in
size) loaves unto steamer and for about 20 minutes or until a
toothpick inserted into center of loaf comes out clean. Four loaves
is enough for about 12-16 servings. Note: Dumplings may also be
boiled, in which case you must cut each loaf in half; however
steaming produces larger and lighter dumplings. If you wish you may
refrigerate dumplings until cold carefully slice and wrap in plastic
wrap then foil and freeze.

Bread Fat Substitute - Applesauce

breads

1  no ingredients

Try substituting unsweetened applesauce for the fats called for in
your bread recipes. This even works with chocolate cake! Many can't
tell any difference in taste and the pectin in the applesauce keeps
the bread moist longer. I buy the small Motts individual containers
so I don't have a large jar going bad in the fridge. I've read that
you can use up to one tablespoon of applesauce per cup of flour. If
you do make this substitution hold out about 1/8 to 1/4 cup of the
liquid in the recipe and add it back in a tsp. at a time during the
kneading cycle.

Bread Making ( Lesson Four Of Four)

breads

1 (in which we get a little
1  fancy)

First, let's review the basic recipe for one loaf of "plain" white
bread --

3 c  all-purpose flour 1 pkg yeast 1 1/4 c liquid (water or
milk...milk recommended) 1 egg (optional but recommended) An egg can
be added for extra flavor and nutrition; it softens the crust and
gives the interior a finer crumb. 1 teaspoon salt (optional but
recommended) 1 tablespoon sugar (optional but recommended)

Mix about three minutes until dough does not stick to floured fingers.
Knead for no less than 10 minutes; cover with towel and let it rise
in a warm (75 - 80 F) place for about an hour, or until it has about
doubled in size; punch it down; let it rest about 15 minutes; place
in greased bread pan; cover; let it rise about another hour; bake at
400 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes or until it sounds "hollow" when
thumped; remove from pan; let cool.

To make 2 loaves, simply double everything EXCEPT the yeast.

Now, for a couple of variations on a theme:

Rye bread -- instead of 3 cups of all-purpose flour, use 2 cups of
all- purpose and 1 cup of rye flour (available at a health food
store)...add 2 tablespoons of caraway seed to the dough...use
buttermilk instead of plain milk or water...add 1/3 cup of light
molasses to the dough...omit the sugar...the egg is still
optional...instead of baking in a bread pan, shape into a round ball
and bake on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Reduce the baking
temperature to 350 degrees...baking time may be 5 - 10 minutes
longer...(One loaf).

Whole wheat bread -- increase sugar to 1 1/2 tablespoons...use 1 1/2
cups of all-purpose flour and 2 cups of whole-wheat flour...use milk
instead of water...add 1/4 cup of butter or margarine...add 1/2 cup
molasses...the egg is still optional.  The method is the same except
the baking time may be 5 - 10 minutes longer.

For the above two variations, do NOT be tempted to use ALL rye flour
or ALL whole-wheat flour.  Those flours do not have enough gluten in
them for proper rising action, so you MUST use some all-purpose
flour, otherwise your finished product will be very heavy and close
textured.

For high-altitude baking (above 5,000 feet), use 1/2 the yeast. Yeast
dough rises faster at high altitudes.

A "perfect" loaf of bread should:

o  Have a well-browned, evenly rounded top o Have a soft and moist
interior, easily pulled apart o Have a uniform color o Have an even
texture -- holes are small and uniform in size from top to bottom

To keep bread fresh, wrap each cooled loaf in foil or plastic wrap,
or seal in a plastic bag; store in a cool, dry cupboard or bread box.
Bread may be stored in the refrigerator but it goes stale more
quickly.

Bread keeps in the freezer for up to 3 months if tightly wrapped in
foil, heavy-duty plastic wrap, or freezer wrap, or sealed in plastic
bags. Always make sure to press out as much air as possible.

Well, that's about it, li'l buckaroos.  Don't be afraid to experiment
~ Add raisins, nuts, cheese, finely diced and lightly sauteed onions,
or anything else you can think of to the dough.  Add green food
coloring for St. Patrick's day!  Add a squid or two...play around
with using different liquids...a friend of mine recently told me she
was baking a cake and ran out of milk, so she substituted baby
formula...said it was the best cake she'd ever made! Play around with
different shapes...knots, pinwheels, crescents, rolls, etc.  Use your
imagination! Make a heart-shaped loaf of bread for Valentine's day or
a birthday! Tell us about your successes, give your not-so-valiant.

brown. Serve warm with Whiskey Sauce (below).

WHISKEY SAUCE

Cream butter and sugar over medium heat until all butter is absorbed.
Remove from heat and blend in egg yolk. Pour in bourbon gradually to
your own taste, stirring constantly. Sauce will thicken as it cools.

NOTE: For a variety of sauces, just substitute your favorite fruit
juice or liqueur to complement your bread pudding.

On a personal note, a lemon sauce or a hard sauce is great with Bread
Pudding too.

Bread Recipe

breads

6 cup flour
1 pkg dry yeast
1/2 cup milk
3 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon butter or margarine

Heat the milk 3 tbsp butter and 1.5 cups water to about 130 degrees.
Add this to 2 cups of flour and the rest of the dry ingredients and
beat for about 2 minutes at medium speed till you have a batter add
aprox 3 cups of flour beating with a large spoon until you have a
soft dough adding aditional flour as needed.
Knead this on a lightly flowered surface for about 10 minutes until
the dough is smooth and elastic. form this into a ball and let rise
in a lightly greased bowl for 1 hour or until doubled.
When doubled punch down and push edges into middle then cut in half
cover and let rest for 15 minutes. Form into loaves and place in
lightly greased pan to again double. Preheat oven to 400 degrees then
bake for about 25 to 30 minutes.
This makes a nice tasty bread but I would like it to be not as
dense. Where do I start: 1. more or less kneading? 2. use less flour?
3. more

Bread Sticks

breads

1 pizza dough of choice
1/2 stick margerine
1 garlic powder
1 parmesean cheese

After making the dough for your pizza you place it on a piece of
heavy duty aluminium foil. Spread it into a circular pizza shape.
Take your pizza cutter and score the dough into 1/2" slices and then
cut the entire pie in half.  Melt a 1/2 stick of margerine and add
1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder(add more or less to suit you). Spread
this on your bread sticks. Top the bread with parmesean cheese and
place aluminum foil directly on oven rack-no pan needed-at 450
degrees until crispy and browned. I always make an extra crust when
making pizza for my family. After eating the bread sticks no one
wants much pizza. I hope you like it. Mary in Memphis

Breadsticks With Black Pepper & Cheddar

breads, cheese

2 1/2 cup unbleached flour plus
1/2 cup (approximately for kneading
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 tablespoon active dry yeast
1 pinch sugar (generous)
1 1/2 cup ; warm water
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
3  scallions; sliced thin - (abt. 1/4
1 cup grated cheddar cheese
1 egg white; lightly beaten - with 1
1  cornmeal
1 kosher salt (opt'l.)

In a mixing bowl, combine 1 1/2 c. of the unbleached flour with the
whole wheat flour and salt.  Make a well in the flour and add yeast,
sugar and 1/2 c. of the warm water. Let yeast stand until foamy,
about 5 to 10 minutes.

Stir in another 1/2 c. water and the oil.  Add remaining water and
stir the batter vigorously with a wooden spoon. Add 1/2 c. flour and
beat well. Stir in the pepper, scallions, cheese and another 1/2 c.
flour; blend well.

Sprinkle about 1/4 c. of the flour for kneading on a pastry board or
marble and turn the dough out onto it. Knead, adding the rest of the
flour as needed, until the dough is smooth and homogeneous and
springs back when pressed with your thumb.  The dough will be
slightly sticky, but should not be too sticky.  Add a bit more flour
if necessary.

Cover the dough with a clean, dry tea towel and let it rest 5 to 10
minutes.  Roll it into a cylinder about 20 to 24" long and cut the
cylinder into about 20 pieces with a sharp knife. Let the pieces
rest, covered, for 5 minutes.

Lightly oil two baking sheets and sprinkle them lightly with
cornmeal. Roll each piece of dough into a cylinder about 10" long and
3/4" wide, and place ten of them on each baking sheet. If you prefer
smaller breadsticks, cut each one in half crosswise.

Preheat the oven to 350 F. and set the baking sheets, covered with
clean tea towels, in a warm place to rise. Gas ovens generate a
warmth while preheating which is just right for raising the dough;
just turn the baking sheets occasionally to ensure even heat. If you
have an electric oven, choose a different place for raising. Let the
sticks rise 25 to 30 minutes, until they have increased in size by
about 50 percent.

With a sharp knife, make five or six diagonal slashes on top of each
breadstick.  Brush them lightly with the egg white and water mixture.
Sprinkle very lightly with salt, if desired.

Bake breadsticks for 20 to 25 minutes (16 to 20 minutes if you've cut
them in half), changing the position of the baking sheets on the oven
racks about halfway through baking time. The breadsticks should be
golden brown.

Eat them right away or let them cool and store them in tightly closed
tins; wrapped tightly, they can be stored in the freezer for up to a
month. Wrap them in foil and gently reheat at 300 F. for 10 to 12
minutes (slightly longer if frozen) before serving.


Belsinger and Dille write: "More like small baguettes than the
completely dry commercial breadsticks, these have a crisp crust and a
chewy, bready interior.  They have a nice, lingering, peppery
aftertaste that complements most soups and salads, and aperitifs or
cocktails, and they're excellent party fare."

BUUREBROT / SWISS HALF-RYE BREAD

breads

150 gm rye flour
850 gm strong white flour
3 cup water
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon dry yeast

("Strong white" flour is the UK term for all-purpose flour.) Mix the
yeast in 1/2 C of the water at blood heat, and leave 15 minutes to
proof. Sift the mixed wheat and rye flours into a mixing bowl to
warm. When the yeast has proofed, make a well in the flour, pour the
yeast mixture in, and cover it over with a little flour. Leave for 20
minutes to "set the sponge". When this time has elapsed, begin mixing
(or kneading with the dough hook if using a mixer). Add 2 cups of the
water, check for texture, and add the rest if necessary. Knead
vigorously. If using a dough hook, somewhere about 10 minutes into
the process the dough will suddenly change texture and require more
flour. Add it (probably about another 150 g). Turn the dough into an
oiled bowl to rise. The texture will be somewhat sticky. After
allowing to rise for 1-1&1/2 hours, turn out of the bowl, punch down,

Cake Doughnuts (Crocker)

breads, crockpot

1  vegetable oil
3 1/3 cup all-purpose flour*
1 cup sugar
3/4 cup milk
2 tablespoon shortening
3 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2  eggs

Heat oil (2 to 3 inches) in deep fryer or Dutch oven to 375F Beat 1.5
cups of the flour and the remaining ingredients in 1.5-quart bowl on
low speed, scraping bowl constantly, 30 seconds. Beat on medium
speed, scraping bowl occasionally, 2 minutes. Stir in remaining flour.

Turn the dough onto generously floured cloth-covered board; roll
around lightly to coat with flour. Gently roll 3/8 inch thick Cut
with floured doughnut cutter. Slide doughnuts into hot oil with wide
spatula. Turn doughnuts as they rise to surface. Fry until golden
brown, 1 to 1.5 minutes on each side. Remove carefully from oil (do
not prick surfaces); drain. Serve plain or shake one at a time in a
bag with powdered sugar. 2 dozen doughnuts;150 calories per doughnut.

*If using self rising flour; omit babng powder and salt.

Buttermilk Doughnuts: Do not use self rising flour. Substitute
buttermilk for the milk. Decrease baking powder to 2 ts and beat in 1
ts baking soda.

NOTE: Hot fat cools somewhat when foods are dropped into it. While
foods are frying, temperature of fat should be 370F to 380F. If fat
is too hot, foods brown before they are cooked through; if too cool,
foods become grease-soaked. A deep-fat thermometer is a good
investment; checking it helps maintain a constant temperature. Do not
use a candy thermometer for deep-fat fiying as it does not register
high enough.

overnight. Cut the cheese mixture into squares, or use a 1 1/2 inch
round cookie cutter. Beat the eggs with the water. Roll the cheese
pieces in the bread crumbs, then dip them in the egg mixture. Roll
them in the crumbs again, and shake off any excess crumbs. Heat the
veg. oil to 375 F. in a deep-fat fryer or heavy saucepan. Drop the
cheese pieces a few at a time into the oil. DO NOT CROWD THE PAN. Fry

1 cup sugar
6 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 cup butter or regular margarine
2 each eggs; lg
1 cup water
4 cup unbleached flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup sugar
2 cup milk

Thinly peel the oranges, using a vegetable peeler. Cut the orange
rind into thin slivers. (Reserve the oranges for another use, or eat
them and enjoy.) Combine the orange rind and 1 cup of water in a 2
quart saucepan and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat, cover, and
simmer for 15 minutes or until the rind is tender. Add the 1 cup of
sugar and continue cooking, uncovered, until the mixture is syrupy,
about 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, sift the
flour, baking powder and salt together in a bowl and set aside.
Cream the butter and 1/2 cup of sugar together until light and
fluffy, using a electric mixer set on medium. Add the eggs and blend
well. Blend in the cooled orange rind mixture. Add the dry ingredients
alternately with the milk to the creamed mixture, beating well after
each addition. Pour the batter into 2 greased 9 X 5 X 3-inch loaf
pans. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F. oven for 50 minutes or until
a cake tester or wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to wire racks to
finish cooling. Wrap in aluminum foil and let stand overnight before
slicing. This bread slices better when it has cooled for 24 hours.

breads, desserts

1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup icing sugar
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1/4 cup corn syrup (dark is best)
1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk

An upside down toffee-like confection.

First Layer: Measure first 3 ingredients into bowl. Crumble together
well. Press in ungreased 8 x 8-inch pan. Bake in 350 F oven for 20 to
25 minutes. Cool.

Second Layer: Melt the scond amount of butter and corn syrup in heavy
saucepan. Measure sugar in cup. Stir in gelatin to mix thoroughly.
Add to saucepan stirring to dissolve. Add condensed milk. Stir,
bringing to a boil. Boil 4 minutes stirring constantly. It burns very
easily when boiling. Remove from heat. Beat with spoon until it
thickens and gets blobby. You will need to take a moment's rest now
and then as you beat. Pour over first layer. Chill overnight. Invert
on plastic wrap. This makes it much easier to cur through to the
bottom. Cut into 25 squares.

begins to rise, about 30 minutes.

Prepare Caramel Topping while dough is rising.  Pour topping into
greased 9-inch round cake or pie pan.

Process on/off.  Turn dough onto lightly greased surface. Divide into
12 equal parts.  Shape each into ball, dip in melted butter and
arrange over Caramel Topping in pan. Let stand in warm place until
doubled, about 1 hour.

Heat oven to 400 F.  Bake buns until brown, 10 - 12 minutes. Cool
about one minute, then invert buns onto serving plate. Serve warm or
at room temperature.

CARAMEL TOPPING: 3 Tbsp packed brown sugar 3 Tbsp butter or margarine
2 Tbsp dark corn syrup 1/4 cup chopped walnuts or pecans

Carnival Fritters (Castagnole)

breads, desserts, ethnic

1 cup hot water
8 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup all-purpose flour, sifted
4  eggs
1 teaspoon freshly grated orange rind
1 teaspoon freshly grated lemon rind
4 cup peanut oil
1  confectioners sugar

Combine the water, butter, sugar, and salt in a small sauce pan and
bring to a boil. When butter is melted, add flour. Stir vigorously
with a whisk until the mixture leaves the sides of the pan, a matter
of seconds. Remove from heat and cool slightly.

Add the eggs, one at a time, beating vigorously with a spoon after
each addition. Add the grated orange and lemon rinds. Mix thoroughly
until smooth.

In a deep skillet, heat the peanut oil to 300° F (the temperature is
important because if the oil is too hot, the fritters will cook too
fast on the outside and not puff up.)

Drop the batter by the tablespoonful into the hot oil, no more than 4
or 5 at a time. When the fritters are browned and puffed, remove them
with a slotted spoon, drain on paper towels, and sprinkle with
confectioners sugar.

Casareccio (Rustic Wholewheat Bread)

breads, italian, bakery

1 teaspoon dried yeast
1/4 cup warm water
3 1/2 cup water at room temperature
13/16 cup biga pugliese, see recipe
3 3/4 cup wholewheat flour
3 3/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon salt
1/3 lb walnuts -=or=-
1/2 cup shelled pistachios -=or=-
1/3 cup pitted italian black olive, - all o; ptional

Stir the yeast into the warm water & let proof for 10 minutes. Add the
remaining water & the biga, then the flours & the salt. Mix with a
wooden spoon for 5 minutes. The dough will not pull away from the
side of the bowl.  Wet your hands & knead on a lightly floured board
to ensure that all the ingredients are well mixed. Turn into a
lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap & let rise at room
temperature until it has almost tripled in volume, 3 to 5 hours. This
dough works very well if left to rise overnight or in the
refrigerator. Let it come back to room temperature before shaping.
Flour your work surface very well & flour a scaper. Turn the dough
onto the work surface, but do not punch down. Divide into 3 equal
pieces. Work in your filling if using by flattening the dough &
sprinkling equal amounts of filing over the dough. Turn in the sides
of the dough & roll each piece into a ball, being gentle but at the
same time pulling the skin taut. Place the loaves on floured
parchment paper set on baking sheets, cover with a heavy cloth & let
rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 450F.  Bake the
loaves for 15 minutes. At this point the dough should be set you can
remove the paper. Slide the loaves directly onto the baking sheets &
bake until crusty & golden, about 30 to 35 minutes.

Cascaron -- Bitsu-Bitsu (Dough Balls)

desserts, doughnuts, filipino

1 pkg mochi flour
1  coconut; grated, place coconut in
1 1/2 cup hot water; pour into bowl of coconut
1/3  box of dark brown sugar
1/4 cup cold water

Squeeze grated coconut in water than strain coconut water in clean
dish towel over another bowl.  Squeeze until all liquid has been
extracted. (Instead of fresh coconut, you may use 1/2 can of grated
coconut and 1
1/2    cups of water.)
Place canned coconut in flour and add water until dough is soft
but not too sticky.  Do the same with fresh coconut. Shape dough in
balls of 1 inch diameter and fry in deep fat until golden brown.
Drain dough balls on paper towel.  Then put them in a large mixing
bowl.
When all have been fried, boil water and brown sugar in a small
sauce pan until it reaches the soft boil stage. This is done by
placing a drop of syrup in a bowl of cold water. If it retains it
shape and is soft, it is ready.  Pour over dough balls.  Mix well so
that all are coated with syrup. Remove from bowl and place them in a
platter to cool. Excellent with coffee or tea.

Cato's Cheese Bread

breads

1 cup feta cheese, drained,
1  crumbled, and packed into
1  the measuring cup
1/2 cup unbleached, all-purpose
1  flour
1  egg, beaten
6  bay leaves
2 tablespoon honey

1) Put the cheese into a medium sized mixing bowl. Mash well with
the fingers until it becomes a smooth, lumpless paste. Add the flour
and mix well with the fingers. Add the beaten egg and mix well. The
dough will be rather sticky.

2) Divide the dough into two equal parts, then form two round,
flat, 1/2 inch thick loaves.  Lay each on three bay leaves set on a
greased baking sheet, and bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 1
to 1-1/2 hours, or until cooked through.

3) Remove the loaves from the oven, spread the tops with the
honey, and let cool.  Remove the bay leaves before serving. NOTE: If
feta cheese is unavailable, use 1 cup cottage cheese and add 1/4 cup
extra flour (but the taste is inferior).

Cato's Grape Bread

breads

4 cup unbleached, all-purpose
1  flour
1/2 cup lard, shortening, or butter
1  melted and cooled
1/4 cup feta cheese, crumbled and
1  mashed into a paste
1 teaspoon cumin seed, ground
1 teaspoon anise, ground
1 1/2 cup grape juice, purple or white
1 pkg dry yeast
8  bay leaves

1) Place the flour, lard, mashed cheese, ground cumin and anise,
and yeast in a large mixing bowl. Blend well. Add the grape juice and
mix the dough well for 2-3 minutes until all the grape juice is
absorbed and evenly distributed.  The dough will be damp and sticky,
but no internal dry areas should appear by the end of the mixing. If
they do, mix a few minutes more or add a little more grape juice and
mix again.

2) Let the dough rest 5 minutes.  Now sprinkle 1 or 2 tbsp. flour
over the dough and knead, either in the bowl or on a lightly floured
surface for 5-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic and
only slightly sticky.  Add more flour if needed.  Let the dough rest
2 minutes.

3) The dough should now be very smooth and easy to handle. Knead 30
seconds more, return the dough to the bowl, cover the bowl with a dish
towel or large plate, and let rise at room temperature for at least 3
hours.

4) Sprinkle top with flour, punch down, and form the dough into 4
rectangular loaves (4 in. by 2 in. by 2-1/2 in.). Place two bay
leaves on the bottom of each loaf, and lay them, leaf side down, on a
greased cookie sheet.  Cover with a towel and let rise for 1 hour,
until well risen.

5) Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 35 minutes, until the
loaves are brown on top and make a hollow sound when tapped on the
bottom. Serve when cool. NOTE: To make these breads without
leavening, omit the yeast, knead the dough thoroughly, then bake at
350 degrees for about 2 hours. They will be chewy and moist, and very
foreign to our taste. The Romans thought unleaven bread was manlier
and much better for the digestion.

1 single with 1 tablespoon water (a w
1 single poppy seeds

Add 1 Tablespoon sugar and yeast to warm water, stir well and "proof"
the yeast (I'm old-fashioned and still do this). After the yeast
proofs, add rest of the sugar, butter/margerine, 3 lightly beaten
eggs, and five cups flour.  As your stir together, add salt (done
this way because salt can kill yeast if added directly). Beat
ingredients with a spoon, gradually adding flour, until dough is
stiff.  Knead on board until dough is smooth and elastic (8-10mins).
Cover and let rise in warm place -- until about doubled in size
(1.5-2hrs).
Punch down and knead dough until all the bubbles are gone. Divide
into 6 parts, roll each part between your hands into a rope about 1"
in diameter. Braid 3 ropes each into 2 loaves. Place two braids about
6" apart on a buttered/margerined cookie sheet, and allow to raise in
a warm place until almost doubled in size. Brush tops with egg/water
wash and sprinkle lightly with poppy seeds.  Bake in pre-heated 400ø
oven for 35-40 mins, or until loaves sound hollow when tapped. Cool

Challah French Toast

breads, breakfast, french

6  eggs
1/2 cup heavy cream, half-and-half or milk
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoon to 6 t clarified butter
8 slice challah, cut 1-inch thick

Beat the eggs together with cream, half-and-half, or milk. Beat in
cinnamon and salt. Melt the butter in a large frying pan. Dip the
challah slices, one at a time, into the egg mixture, making sure that
each slice is well coated. The challah should absorb a little of the
egg mixture but not enough to get soggy. Fry each battered challah
slice for 2-3 minutes on each side until they are golden brown. Don't
fry too fast or the inside will be wet and gooey. Serve with your
favorite jam, maple syrup, honey, cinnamon, sugar, or plain. NOTE:
Heavy cream really is the best liquid to use in this recipe.

Challah I

breads, jewish

2 1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon yeast (active), dry (one package)
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon salt (optional)
1/4 cup oil
2  eggs, beaten
10 cup flour (or less)
1  egg yolk
1 tablespoon water

Dissolve the yeast and sugar in lukewarm water (105 degrees F.). (Lukewarm
water feels neither hot nor cold when a drop is placed on your wrist.) Let
sit for 10 minutes to proof the yeast.  If there are no bubbles in the
water after this time, the yeast is inactive and you should start over with
new yeast.

Add the salt (optional), oil, eggs and most of the flour to the 2 1/4 cups
of water. Mix. Place dough on floured board and knead for 5-10 minutes.

Place dough in a clean bowl, brush some oil on the top (optional) and cover
the bowl with a towel.  Let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 1/2
hours.

Punch the dough down and let rise until doubled again (maybe another hour).

Punch dough down and place onto floured board.  Form into two loaves. You
can make normal loaves, or you can cut the dough and braid (with three or
six pieces per loaf), or you can make braided or un-braided rolls, or you
can roll the dough out until it's about 1/4 inch thick and then spread
fried onions over it. Place loaves into oiled pans.

Cover pans and let rise for about 30 minutes.  (Skip this step if you've
rolled the dough out and covered with onions.)

Mix the egg yolk with about 1 tablespoon of water.  Brush loaves with this
mixture.  (Again, skip this if you've rolled the dough out.) Bake at 400
degrees F. for 20 minutes, then lower heat to 350 degrees F. and bake for
40 additional minutes. If you are making rolls, you probably need to bake
for a total of 20-25 minutes.

You can add poppy or sesame seeds to the dough, or you can sprinkle the
seeds on top. This bread is traditionally made with white flour, but is
still good if made with all or part whole wheat flour. I think its good
taste comes from the oil and eggs in the dough.

NOTES:

*  Challah is a traditional Jewish bread that is part of many festivals,
including sabbath dinners and weddings.  For making a wedding loaf, this
recipe can be doubled and used to make one braided loaf. It will fill up
the entire oven, and you will have to find a cookie sheet big enough to put
the loaf on. Yield: 2 loaves.

: Difficulty:  easy, as bread goes.
: Time:  preparation:  3-5 hours (including rising); baking:  1 hour.
: Precision:  measure ingredients carefully.

Challah II

breads, jewish

      ----DOUGH----
1/2 oz yeast (active), dry (2 packages)
2 cup water, warm
4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup sugar, granulated
3 large eggs
3/4 cup vegetable oil (up to about 1/4 cup; more, to taste)
9 cup flour, all-purpose (more if needed)
      ----GLAZE----
1 large egg
1  sesame or poppy seeds

Mix yeast in warm water.  Let sit 5 minutes.  In a large bowl combine salt,
sugar, eggs and oil.  Add yeast mixture.  Slowly add flour, stirring until
not too sticky. When the dough becomes too thick to stir, turn it out onto
a floured board and knead, adding flour as necessary. Scrape the working
surface with a plastic dough spatula from time to time, to keep a dry skin
from forming on it.  You may find that you need more flour, but don't add
too much more, or the dough will become heavy. Knead until the dough is
smooth and elastic (about 10 minutes).

Form dough into a ball and place in a lightly oiled large bowl, turning to
coat the dough with oil.  A ceramic bowl is best.  Cover the bowl with a
clean cloth and leave in a warm, draft-free place to rise for 1 1/2 hours,
or until doubled in bulk. After the dough has risen, punch it down and
divide it into 6 balls. Let the dough balls sit for 5 minutes, covered.

Keeping dough balls covered while working, remove a ball and roll it
between your hands (or on working surface) into a cord about 1 inch wide by
about 20 inches long. The dough is quite elastic, making it nicely
workable, yet also tending to make it shrink back slightly after being
lengthened.  I find it best to lengthen it in a series of passes. Form 3
cords this way, and then start from the middle and braid them into a single
loaf.  Tuck the ends under. It's a little harder to figure out how to start
braiding from the middle, but the loaves come out more even and attractive
that way.  Don't pull the cords while braiding. Place the loaf on a lightly
oiled baking sheet, and cover it with a cloth while you form the other
loaf.  Keep the loaves well apart on the baking sheet, since they will
expand a lot. Cover the loaves and place again into a warm, draft-free
place to rise for 45-60 minutes.

After the loaves have risen, gently brush the tops with beaten egg using a
soft brush, and then sprinkle with the seeds.  Bake at 350 degrees F. for
30 minutes, or until golden brown.

NOTES:

*  Challah (pronounced "hallah") is a type of braided egg bread
traditionally eaten on the Jewish Sabbath. It is eaten by tearing off hunks
rather than by cutting with a knife.

I got this recipe from a housemate a couple of years ago; I don't know its
origins before that, but it has become one of my favorite recipes, and one
with which I have experimented a good deal.  I've tried several other
challah recipes, but find I like this one the best. Yield: 2 Large loaves.

*  The variation in oil makes quite a difference in the moisture of the
bread: If you use the larger quantity, the bread comes out very nice and
moist, but when it cools it becomes somewhat oily.

The amounts of sugar and oil may sound high, but try it this way once
before cutting back. I have tried other recipes that use less, and they
don't taste nearly as good.

*  Here's the fun part --> variations.  Because this dough is so workable,
you can form it many different ways, limited only by your imagination; I
once made a whole collection of different shapes and sizes, for a festive
dinner party.

Some of the variations I have tried include:

:  o  Adding extra ingredients, such as raisins and/or nuts
:  o  Forming the braided loaf into a wreath-like loop (joining the ends)
:  o  Braiding 5 ways instead of 3
:  o  Baking a small loaf on top of a larger loaf (traditional)
:  o  Braiding 3 braided loaves into a recursive loaf (didn't turn out
well; it ended up looking knotty, rather than intricate, and being somewhat
tough)
:  o  Varying the loaf sizes.  One time I made individual-sized loaves, so
that everyone could have their own loaf at dinner. Another time, I divided
the dough into 2 halves, set one aside, and made a loaf out of the other
half. Then, I divided the remaining piece into 2 halves, and continued the
process until I had an array of loaves, each half the size of the previous.
I managed to get 9 loaves by doing this, the smallest of which was about
1/4    inch by about 2 inches.

:  o  Varying the length-to-width proportions; traditionally, challah
loaves are quite wide relative to their length. I find that shorter, wider
loaves are doughier (and thus tastier), but longer loaves look more
elegant.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  30 minutes dough preparation, 1 1/2 hours first rising, 1 hour
loaf forming, 1 hour second rising, 30 minutes baking. Total: 4 1/2 hours.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

Challah III

breads

3/4 oz yeast (3 packages)
3/4 cup water, water
2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 tablespoon salt
1/4 cup honey
2 cup raisins
8  eggs
9 cup flour
      ----GLAZE----
2  egg yolks
5 teaspoon water

Dissolve the yeast with the warm water and sugar.  Add the rest of the
sugar, butter, salt, honey, raisins and eggs. Add the flour, a cup at a
time, until it is hard to stir.

Turn out onto a well-floured counter and knead until smooth and blistery,
adding more flour as necessary (about 10-15 minutes).  Put into greased
bowl, cover, and let rise until double, about 1 hr.

Punch down.  Separate into 4 sections and separate each section into 3 more
sections. Roll each piece out to the size of your cookie sheet. Braid 3
strands together and place on cookie sheet. Let rise until double (about
1    hour).

Mix egg yolks and water for glaze.  Spread on loaves.  Bake in a preheated
oven at 350 degrees F. for 15-30 minutes until there is a golden crust.

NOTES:

*  Jewish egg bread -- This is my family's version of Challah.  It calls
for saffron, but I've never actually made it as such (Hey, I'm just a poor
college student, I can't afford saffron).

: Difficulty:  easy, if you know how to make bread
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, several hours rising, 30 minutes cooking
: Precision:  Raisins are to taste.  Measure the rest of the ingredients.

Challah Or Koilitch+

breads, jewish, heirloom

1 pkg yeast
1 tablespoon sugar
1 1/4 cup tepid water
4 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
2 teaspoon salt
2  eggs, lightly beaten
2 tablespoon butter, melted
1  egg yolk
1  poppy seeds

Method: Combine the yeast and sugar in the mixing bowl of a table top
mixer and dissolve in 1-1/4 cup tepid water.  In a large mixing bowl,
sift together the flour and the salt.  Add the eggs and melted and
cooled butter and 2/3 of the flour mixture to the yeast mixture.  Mix
at speed 2 for 2 minutes, then add the flour up to the point that the
dough leaves the sides of the bowl.  Grease large bowl and place the
dough in it turning to grease the top.  Cover with a kitchen towel.
Let rise in a draftless warm place for approximately 1 hour.  Take
2/3 of the dough and make a braid with it about 1 foot long.  Place
it on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Put kitty-corner, squarely in
the middle. Brush braid with the egg yolk. Take the rest of the dough
and make a smaller braid only 10 inches long. Take the side of your
hand and press firmly along the top of the larger braid (to keep
smaller braid in place as it is baking). Place smaller braid on top.
Brush the top braid with egg yolk and sprinkle liberally with poppy
seeds.

Let rise in a warm place again, about 40 minutes; don't let it rise
too much.  Bake in preheated oven at 375 degrees F. for 40 to 45
minutes. Check after about 25 minutes to see that it isn't getting
too dark. If it is, place a piece of foil over it for the balance of
the baking time. Wrap leftovers, if any, in wax paper.

Challah~ Favorite Recipe

breads

1 1/4 cup cold water
2 pkg dry yeast
2 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoon butter or margarine
1/2 cup sugar (+ 1 t if desired)
3  eggs
7 cup unbleached flour (approx.)
1  egg yold mixed w/ 1 t water
1 1/2 cup golden raising (optional)

In large bowl of electric mixer, thoroughly mix undissolved yeast
with 1/3 of the flour and all other dry ingredients. In a 2 to 4 cup
measure, start with 1 1/4 cups cold water. Add margarine, then add
enough water to make 2 cups liquid.  Heat liquids with margarine over
low heat unitl very warm, 110 to 120 degrees. Margarine does not need
to melt. Add liquids to dry ingredients.  Beat for 2 minutes at
medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add about
1/2 cup flour, or enough flour to make a thick batter. Add the 3 eggs
one at a time. Beat on high speed for 2 minutes, scraping bowl
occasionally. Use dough hook or wooden spoon to stir, adding all but
one cup of flour or as much as is needed to make elastic dough.
Amount will vary according to temperature and humidity of room.  If
raisins are used, add here and stir thoroughly. Turn dough out on
floured surface, kneading until it becomes smooth and satiny to the
touch. Add more flour if needed. Place dough in well-greased bowl,
turning to grease top of dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise
until doubled in bulk, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Punch down. Return to
lightly floured board. Cut into desired amount of loaves. This recipe
makes 1 very large, 2 large or 3 medium loaves. Cut amount of dough
desired. Stretch into one strand and twist to form a crown.
Paint egg mixture. Repeat with remaining dough. Tops may be sprinkled
with sesame or poppy seeds. After bread has risen for about an hour,
brush any dry areas with egg wash. Prick any air bubbles. Bake in
375-degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until browned. A flick of
finger should produce a hollow sound. Remove to rack to cool. Challah

Chapatis

breads

1 1/2 cup flour, unbleached
1/2 cup flour, whole wheat
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon ghi
1/2 cup ; water

Mix flours, salt, and butter and add just enough water to make a firm
dough, somewhat like a biscuit dough. Knead for 10-15 minutes - the
more the dough is kneaded, the lighter the bread will be. Shape the
dough into a ball, cover with a sheet of plastic and let it rest for
at least 1 hour. If left to rest overnight in the refrigerator, the
finished bread will be even lighter. When ready to bake, take a small
piece of dough about the size of a golf ball, or a bit smaller. On a
lightly floured board, roll the dough into a thin circle, about 5
inches in diameter. Repeat with all the dough. Heat a griddle or
heavy-bottomed iron skillet until it is very hot (you will notice the
smoke rising from it). Place the rolled out chapati on the griddle
and let it cook for 2-3 minutes, depending on how thin you have
rolled it. Using a pair of kitchen tongs, you can lift the chapati to
see if the underside has turned a golden brown. Flip, and cook the
other side about 1 minute. As they are cooked, store the chapatis on
a towel in a warm covered container until ready to serve. Serve as
soon as the last chapati is baked. NOTE: In India breads sometimes
are baked in the fiery clay tandoor, where they develop brown spots
and bubbles. To achieve a similar effect at home, you can use tongs
to hold each chapati over a hot gas flame until it puffs like a
little balloon.  The chapati will collapse as it cools.

Chapatis #2

breads, indian

2 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup water

Yield:  12 Chapatis Cooking Time: 2 Minutes Each

Put the flour and salt into a bowl.  Add the water and mix to a stiff
dough; knead well until the dough feels firm and elastic. Then place
in a greased plastic bag or in grease proof paper and leave in a warm
place for 30 minutes.  Turn onto a floured board, shape the dough
into a long roll, and divide into 12 equal slices. Roll out paper
thin. Heat the heavy frying pan and when very hot, cook the chapatis
for not more than one minute on either side.  Cool in a tea towel.
Chapatis should always be cooked fresh for each meal.

NOTE:

To cook them, you can use an ungreased heavy frying pan, griddle,
bakestone or solid plate.

Left-over chapatis make an attractive crispbread when dried off in a
cool oven.

Cheddar Braids

breads, cheese, yeast bread

1 cup water; warm, 110-115 deg. f.
1 pkg active dry yeast; or
1 tablespoon active dry yeast; bulk
3 1/2 cup unbleached flour; *
1 teaspoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup butter; room temperature
4 each eggs; lg, room temperature
6 oz cheddar; extra sharp, diced
1 each egg; lg
1 tablespoon milk
2 tablespoon celery seeds

*    You can use up to 4 1/2 cups of flour in this recipe depending
on the
weather.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ Pour the warm water into a warm bowl and add the yeast.  Stir to
dissolve then let stand until light and puffed, about 5 minutes.  Add
1 1/2 cups of the flour, sugar and salt.  Beat with an electric mixer
on the lowest speed for 1 minute.  Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes
longer.  Add the butter to the yeast mixture and beat for another 1
minute.  On the lowest speed on the mixer, beat in 1 egg and 1/2 cup
of flour until well blended, repeating until the 4 eggs are used up
and enough flour has been added to make a soft sticky dough.
Continue to beat with the mixer or by hand, until the dough is glossy
and elastic and pulls away from the side of the bowl.  Stir in the
cheddar cheese by hand.  Cover and let rise in a warm place free from
drafts until doubled in bulk, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. When the dough
has doubled in bulk, punch down and place in the refrigerator for at
least 5 hours or better, overnight.  Remove the dough from the
refrigerator.  Divide in half and cover and refrigerate the second
ball of dough.  Knead the remaining ball of dough on a lightly
floured surface until soft and pliable.  Divide the dough into 3
equal parts and roll each piece into a rope 12 to 16-inches long.
Braid the ropes, starting in the middle and working toward each end.
Pinch the ends together so seal them.  Grease a large baking sheet
and place the finished braid on one side of the sheet.  Repeat with
the refrigerated dough.  In a small bowl beat the egg and milk
together.  Brush the braids with the egg mixture and let the braids
rise in a warm place, free from drafts, until dough in bulk, about 1
1/2 to 2 hours.  Do not cover.  Midway through the rising time, brush
with the egg mixture again.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  When
fully risen, brush with the egg mixture for a final time and sprinkle
evenly with the celery seeds.  Bake for 40 minutes in the preheated
oven until a wooden skewer or pick inserted in the braid comes out
dry.  Remove from the oven and from the baking sheet.  Cool to room
temperature, on wire racks, before slicing.

make a stiff but light dough.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly
floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 5 to 8 minutes.
Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top.  Cover with
a dishtowel that has been soaked in hot water and then wrung out
until almost dry.  Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk,
about 1 hour.  Punch the dough down and turn out on a lightly floured
surface and shape into a 20-inch rope.  Place seam side down in a
buttered 6 1/2 cup ring mold, pinching the ends together.  Cover and
let rise in warm place until nearly doubled in bulk, about 35 to 40
minutes. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F. oven for 25 to 30 minutes.
Remove from the ring mold.

1 cup milk
1 cup water
2 tablespoon butter
2 pkg active dry yeast
5 1/3 cup flour
3 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon salt
6 oz sharp cheddar cheese; shredded
1  egg

Combine milk, 1/2 cup of the water, and the butter in a small
saucepan and heat until butter melts. Set aside to cool.

Sprinkle the yeast over remaining water in a small bowl.Set aside to
proof and soften. Place 1 3/4 cups of the flour, the sugar and salt
in a large bowl.

ingredients and beat 2 minutes at medium speed, scraping the sides of
the bowl occasionally. Add cheese, egg and 3/4 cup flour, or enough
to make a thick batter.

Beat on high speed for 2 minutes, again scraping bowl occasionally.
Gradually stir in just enough of the remaining flour to make a stiff
batter so it leaves the sides of the bowl. Cover with a damp cloth
and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Adjust rack in the lower third of oven; preheat ot 375øF. Using a
wooden spoon, stir the raised batter down until it is almost its
original volume. Beat for 1 minute.

Cheese Bread (Libum)

breads

1 cup feta cheese, drained,
1  crumbled, and packed into
1  the measuring cup
1/2 cup unbleached, all-purpose
1  flour
1  egg, beaten
6  bay leaves
2 tablespoon honey

1) Put the cheese into a medium sized mixing bowl. Mash well with
the fingers until it becomes a smooth, lumpless paste. Add the flour
and mix well with the fingers. Add the beaten egg and mix well. The
dough will be rather sticky.

2) Divide the dough into two equal parts, then form two round,
flat, 1/2 inch thick loaves.  Lay each on three bay leaves set on a
greased baking sheet, and bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 1
to 1-1/2 hours, or until cooked through.

3) Remove the loaves from the oven, spread the tops with the
honey, and let cool.  Remove the bay leaves before serving. NOTE: If
feta cheese is unavailable, use 1 cup cottage cheese and add 1/4 cup
extra flour (but the taste is inferior).

Cheese Scones

beverages, breads, cheese

1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1 pinch salt
1 cup whole-wheat flour
3 teaspoon cold butter or margarine, cut in sm; all pieces
3/4 cup (3oz) finely shredded sharp cheddar; cheese
2/3 cup milk (about)
1  butter

This qualifies as a savory; a bit of a change from the usual scone.

Preheat oven to 425F (220C).  Lightly grease a large baking sheet; set
aside.  Sift all-purpose flour, baking powder, dry mustard and salt
into a large bowl. Stir in the whole-wheat flour. With your fingers,
rub in cold butter until mixture is crumbly.  Stir in 1/2 cup cheese.
Make a well in center of mixture; add milk and mix with a fork to
make a dough that BARELY holds together (you may need to press dough
together with your hands). Turn out onto floured surface and knead
lightly. Roll out with a floured rolling pin or pat dough with your
hands to make a round about 3/4-inch thick. Cut into rounds with a
2-inch fluted or plain cookie cutter. Place 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart
on baking sheet; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese. Bake 8-10
minutes or until well risen and golden. Transfer to a wire rack to
cool.  When cold, split and serve with butter. Makes about 12 scones.

Cheryl's Sourdough Starter

breads, sourdough

      ----CHERYL GAVARD----
1 cup milk
1 tablespoon sugar salt
2 cup flour
1 tablespoon white vinegar

Mix all together, and let sit on your counter for 3 days with a loose
fitting lid or cover with Saran Wrap. On the third day stir it well.
Let sit for two more days. Some recipes call for adding 1 packet of
yeast that has been dissolved in 1/2 cup warm water on the fifth day.
It sort of speeds up the process of it getting sour. If you do add
it, then let the mix sit out for at least one more week, stirring it
every day. If you don't add it, you still have to let it sit out a
week, but, it may not be as sour the first few times you use it.
Store starter in the fridge. It will separate, into two parts, a
darkish liquid on the top ~ this is normal. Before you use it, stir
the liquid back into the bottom part. ALWAYS use a wooden or plastic
spoon. NEVER use metal. Always use glass, ceramic or plastic
bowls...NEVER metal. To use:   Pour out the amount needed. For 1/2
cup starter used, feed with 1/2 cup flour and 1 teaspoon sugar. Stir
in well. Don't worry about flour lumps etc. Let sit out on the
counter with a loose lid overnight! Stir, return to refrigerator.
(According to Cheryl & Connie, you have to wait at least 3 or 4 days
between used!) IF you don't use within a week, feed starter 1
teaspoon sugar, stir in and return to fridge. It's NOT that
hard...and of all the starters I've used, this one so far has been
the best. Thanks Cheryl and Connie! Repost by SALLIE KRATZ NXMB21A

8 oz barbecued pork
4  green onions
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 teaspoon grated pared fresh ginger
1  clove garlic, crushed
1 1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon cornstarch
3 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

NOTE: these buns are cooked in bamboo steamers which are available in
Chinese and specialty gourmet cookware stores. The round steamers can
be pruchased in various sizes separately or in sets of two of three
tiers. For cooking, the covered steamer(s) is (are) placed over
boiling water in a wok or large saucepan. The above is quoted
directly from a section connected to the recipe.  This is my own
note. I do not like the flavor that a bamboo steamer imparts to
recipes; therefore, I bought an aluminum Chinese steamer.
1. Combine hoi sin sauce, oyster sauce, soy sauce and sesame oil.
Chop pork and onions finely.
2. Heat vegetable oil in wok or fry pan over high heat. Stir-fry
ginger and garlic in the oil 1 minute. Stir in hoi sin mixture. Cook
and stir two minutes. Combine 1/2 cup of the water and the constarch.
Blend into hoi sin mixture.  Cook and stir until liquid boils. Reduce
heat to medium and simmer 2 minutes. Stir in pork and onions. Remove
from heat. Cool completely.
3. Combine flour, baking powder and salt in large bowl. Cut or rub in
shortenilng until mixture resembles bread crumbs. Combine remaining
3/4 cup of the water and the vinegar. Mix water-vinegar into flour
until dough sticks together.  Shape dough into ball. Knead on lightly
floured surface 6 or 8 times. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand
20 minutes.
Uncover and knead 4 or 5 more times.  Divide dough into 12 equal
portions.
Shape each portions into a smooth ball.
4. Roll each ball of dough on lightly floured surface into a circle
5 to 6 inches in diameter.  Brush around edges lightly with water.
Spoon a heaping tablespoon of pork mixture onto center of each
circle. Carefully pinch edges together to seal dough around filling.
Bring the two ends of dough over the seam and pinch together.
5. Cut waxed paper into twelve 5-inch squares.  Brush one side of
paper lightly with oil.  Place a bun, seam side down, on each square.
6.Place buns with paper in single layer on steamer rack over boiling
water.  Cover and steam buns until done about 20 minutes. Yield: 1
dozen BARBECUED PORK: 1. Remove and discard fat from meat.
2. Combine soy sauce, wine, sugar, honey, food coloring, cinnamon,
garlic and onion in large bowl. Add pork, turning tenderloins to coat
completely. Cover and let stand at room temperature 1 hour or
refrigerate overnight, turning occasionaly.
3. Drain pork, reserve marinade.  Place pork on wire rack over
baking pan.
4. Bake in preheated 350 degree F. oven until done, about 45 minutes.
Turn and baste frequently during baking.
5. Remove pork from oven.  Cool.  Cut into diagonal slices.

Chive & Dill Batter Bread

breads

1/2 cup warm water
2 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon or packet active dry yeast
2 cup (1pint) lowfat cottage cheese
1/2 cup chopped chives (onions or scallions; )
1  heaping tbsp dill weed, or seeds
2  eggs
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup stone ground whole wheat flour
3 cup unbleached all purpose flour

There are particular batter breads that have become very popular over
the years and this is one of them. Its full of dill, chives, and
lowfat cottage cheese, and contains no other fat at all. But it's so
moist and chewy, you'd never think of eating it with butter.

Pour the warm water into a large mixing bowl and dissolve in it the
sugar and the yeast. While they dissolve, heat the cottage cheese in
a large saucepan until the chill is off. When it has warmed slightly,
add the chives, dill, eggs, salt, baking soda, and flour. Mix this
all up and add it to the yeast mixture, making sure it is all well
blended. The next part, the rising or proofing, takes time, but it's
the yeast that doing all the work.  You can determine how long it
will take by where you put the dough. If you want the yeast to work
quickly, say in 1-1/2 hours, put your bowl somewhere warm and cozy
(75F-85F) If you want the yeast to work slowly, say all day while
you're at work, put the dough somewhere cool (55F-65F) or in the
refrigerator. Make sure your dough is covered so it doesn't dry out,
and then go away and do whatever you have to do. About an hour before
you want to serve your bread, stir it down, and pour it into two
small, lightly greased casserole dishes or 4-1/2x8-1/2 bread pans.
Cover and let them rise again, this time for 3/4 to 1 hour. (If the
dough is cold, the loaves may take a bit more time to rise.) About 15
minutes before you bake your bread, preheat your oven to 350F. Bake
the loaves for 30-35 minutes or until they are brown and crusty.

Chocolate Apricot Kugelhupf

breads, desserts

      ----SPONGE----
1 1/2 cup apricot nectar
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour; sifted
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup nonfat dry milk powder
1 pkg fast-rising dry yeast
      ----DOUGH----
1/2 cup unsalted butter; at room temperature
1 cup sugar
2 large eggs
3 large egg yolks
3 tablespoon apricot brandy
1 1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 pkg fast-rising dry yeast
2 tablespoon hot (125øf) water
3 1/2 cup all-purpose flour; sifted
12 oz bittersweet chocolate; coarsely chopped
6 oz moist dried apricots; quartered
2 tablespoon firmly packed golden brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1  powdered sugar
      ----CHOCOLATE SWIRL CREAM----
2 oz bittersweet chocolate; chopped
2 cup whipping cream; plus
2 tablespoon whipping cream
2 tablespoon sugar
3 tablespoon apricot brandy

For sponge, boil apricot nectar in a heavy medium saucepan over high
heat until reduced to 1 cup, about 5 minutes. Pour reduced nectar
into a large bowl. Cool to 120-125øF. Whisk in flour, sugar, milk
powder and yeast. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a
warm, draft-free area until double in volume, about 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare dough: Generously butter a 12-cup kugelhupf pan. (A
large bundt or angel food pan may be substituted.) Using an electric
mixer, cream butter with sugar in a large bowl until fluffy. Beat in
eggs and egg yolks 1 at a time. Beat in brandy, salt, vanilla and
ginger. Combine yeast and 2 tb hot water in a small bowl and stir
until yeast dissolves. Mix yeast mixture and sponge into butter
mixture. Gradually mix in 3 cups flour. Combine chocolate, apricots,
brown sugar and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Mix into dough.

Spoon dough into prepared pan. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and
clean kitchen towel. Let stand in a warm, draft-free area until dough
rises just to the top of pan, about 3 hours.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350øF. Bake kugelhupf
until deep brown and cracking on top and tester inserted in center
comes out clean, about 48 minutes. Cool on rack 20 minutes. Turn out
onto rack and cool completely.

Meanwhile, make Chocolate Swirl Cream: Stir chocolate and 2 tb cream
in a heavy small saucepan over low heat until chocolate melts and
mixture is smooth. Cool. Beat remaining 2 cups cream and sugar in a
large bowl until soft peaks form. Add brandy and continue beating
until stiff peaks form. Pour chocolate mixture over cream and fold
together until whipped cream is lightly streaked with chocolate.
Transfer to a serving bowl and chill.

Place kugelhupf on a platter. Lightly sift powdered sugar over. Cut
into wedges. Serve with chocolate swirl cream.

Chocolate Bread 2

breads

1  pkg active dry yeast
2 tablespoon sugar
1/4 cup warm water
1 cup warm water
4 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup dutch process cocoa, unsweetened
2 teaspoon salt
1  egg, lightly beaten
2 tablespoon sweet butter, at room temperature
1 cup chocolate morsels

Combine the yeast with half the sugar and the first measure of warm
(110 degree) water. Let stand until foamy (about 3 minutes). Combine
the flour, cocoa and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer. Use a
wooden spoon to stir in the yeast mixture, the butter, remaining
sugar and the second measure of water. Fit the mixer with a dough
hook and knead the dough at medium speed until the dough is smooth
and supple (about 10 minutes). Turn out onto a lightly floured board.
Knead by hand for 1 minute, adding more flour if needed. The dough
must be quite firm, not sticky, as it must stand on its own. Knead in
the chocolate morsels. Place the dough in the mixing bowl. Cover with
greased plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk
(1-1 1/2 hours). Grease the baking pan. Turn the dough out. Punch
down. Knead for 1 minute to expel air. Let rest for 5 minutes. Form
into an 8" x 4" oval. Place on the baking pan. Preheat the oven to
400 degrees. Cover loosely with greased plastic wrap. Let rise until

1/3 cup unsweetened coca powder
2 pkg rapid rise yeast
3/4 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup milk
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup butter/margarine
1  egg
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
1/3 cup milk chocolate or peanut
1  butter morsels
1  decorations (optional) are
1  jelly beans, icing and or c.

In large bowl, combine 1 cup flour, sugar, cocoa powder, undissolved
yeast and salt.  Heat milk, water and butter until very warm (120-130
degrees). Gradually add to dry ingredients; beat 2 minutes at medium
speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add egg, vanilla
and 1/2 cup flour, beat 2 minutes at high speed, scraping bowl
occasionally. With spoon, stir in enough additional flour to make
soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and
elastic, about 4-6 minutes. Cover, let rest on floured surface 10
minutes. Divide dough in half. For body, knead chocolate morsels into
1 half, form into ball. Place on bottom end of large greased baking
sheet; flatten to make 5-inch round. For head, remove 1/3 of
remaining half, form into ball.  Place on large baking sheet above
body, flatten slightly, pinching to attach. For nose, pinch off 1/2
inch ball from remaining dough; place on center of head.  Divide
remaining dough into 4 equal portions, roll each to form 6-inch rope.
For arms, arrange 2 ropes across body; attach by tucking one end of
each under body. Shape remaining ropes into ears; arrange above head.
Attach by tucking one end of each under head.  Cover, let rise in
warm draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30-45 minutes.
Bake at 350 degrees for 45-50 minutes or until done, covering
aluminum foil after 20 minutes to prevent excess browning. Remove
from sheet; cool on wire rack. Decorate as desired.

1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup granulated sugar
2 pkg yeast
2  oranges; zested
2  eggs
4  egg yolks
3 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoon salt
1 cup unsalted butter; (cold) plus
1 tablespoon unsalted butter; (cold)
6 oz bittersweet chocolate - roughly cho; pped
      ----ORANGE GLAZE----
1 cup confectioners' sugar
3 tablespoon orange juice

Scald the milk and let it cool to 110 degrees F.  Add 1/4 cup of the
sugar and the yeast and let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes.
Combine the orange zest with the remaining sugar in a food processor
and process until zest is finely ground. In a heavy-duty electric
mixer, combine the yeast mixture, zest and sugar mixture, eggs and
egg yolks. Beat until combined, about 30 seconds. In a separate bowl,
sift together the flour and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients
to the liquid in the mixer bowl, beating constantly until the dough
is sticky and soft. Add 2 sticks (1 cup) of butter, 1 tablespoon at a
time, beating constantly until combined. Beat an additional 30
seconds. Coat a large bowl with remaining tablespoon butter. Turn the
dough out onto a lightly floured board; form a ball WITHOUT KNEADING
and place in the bowl, turning to coat the dough with butter. Cover
with plastic wrap and a towel and set aside to rise in a warm place
until doubled in bulk, about 1 to 1-1/2 hours. Turn the dough out
onto a lightly floured board.  Punch down to remove air bubbles and
return to the bowl.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate a
minimum of 6 hours, or overnight. Turn the dough out onto a lightly
floured board and gently knead in the chocolate pieces. Divide the
dough into 16 equal parts. Roll each between your hands to form a
1-1/2" round cylinder. To make the traditional brioche topknot, lay
the cylinders on a counter and roll the side of your hand back and
forth at a point about an inch from the top, so you form a shape like
a bowling pin.  Place the dough in buttered brioche tins or muffin
cups, pinched side up, and gently press the tops down toward the
bottom of the tim. Place the tins on a baking sheet, cover with
plastic wrap and a towel and set aside in a warm place to rise until
doubled, about 1-1/2 hours. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Bake for
20 minutes. While the brioches are baking, make the glaze. ORANGE
GLAZE: Whisk the ingredients together to form a paste and spoon about
1 tablespoon over each warm brioche.

Chocolate Peanut Butter Scones

breads, chocolate

2 cup flour
1/2 cup sugar, brown
2 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter, sweet; chilled
3/4 cup peanut butter, creamy
1/4 cup milk
2  egg
2 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup peanuts, unsalted; chopped
1 1/2 oz chocolate, bittersweet

Approx. Cook Time: 0:17
Break chocolate into 8 equal pieces. Preheat oven to 375F. In a
large bowl, stir together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and
salt. Cut the butter into 1/2-inch cubes and distribute them over the
flour mixture. With a pastry blender or two knives used scissors
fashion, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
In a small bowl, stir together the peanut butter mixture to the flour
mixture and knead until combined.  Knead in the peanuts. Pat the
dough out into a 1/2-inch thickness on a cutting board. Using a
floured 2-1/2 in. to 3-in. diameter crinkled round biscuit cutter,
cut out rounds from the dough. Gather the scraps together and repeat
until all the dough is used and there are 16 round.  Place 8 of the
rounds on an ungreased baking sheet. Top each round with a piece of
the chocolate and one of the remaining circles of dough. Press the
edges gently to seal. Bake for 17-19 minutes, or until lightly
browned.  Remove the baking sheet to a wire rack and cool 5 minutes.
Using a spatula, transfer the scones to the wire rack to cool. Serve
warm or cool completely and store in an airtight container. VARIATION
(Randy's Preference):  Make the dough as above, omitting bittersweet
chocolate, substituting 1/2 c. unsalted peanuts for the chopped

Christmas Stollen

breads, swedish

1 cup milk
1/2 cup plus 2 tbsp granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pkg active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water
5 cup sifted all-purpose flour
1/2 cup finely chopped candied citron
1/2 cup finely chopped candied cherries
1 cup slivered almonds
1  grated rind of 1 lemon
1 cup seedless raisins
2  eggs, beaten
1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
2/3 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoon hot water

Pour milk into a saucepan. Heat to scalding. Turn off heat; stir in
1/2 cup of the granulated sugar and the salt. Let mixture cool to
lukewarm. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in the 1/2 cup warm water;
let mixture rest for 5 minutes. Pour lukewarm milk mixture into yeast
solution. Stir in 1 cup of the flour. Beat dough with electric mixer
or egg beater until smooth. Cover bowl with cloth towel; let dough
rise in a warm place 1 hour and 30 minutes or until double in bulk.

Punch down dough in bowl; fold in citron, cherries, almonds, lemon
rind and raisins. Add eggs, 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) of the softened
butter and the nutmeg. Stir in 3 more cups flour; mix dough until
smooth. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead, working
in enough of remaining flour to make dough smooth and elastic. Divide
dough into halves; roll each portion into an oval, about 1/2" thick.

In a small saucepan, melt remaining butter; brush it over ovals. In a
small bowl, combine cinnamon with remaining 2 Tbsp granulated sugar;
sprinkle mixture over ovals. Fold ovals in half, lengthwise. Place
them on buttered baking sheet. Twist ends of each oval toward each
other to form a crescent. Loosely cover ovals with wax paper and a
cloth towel. Let Stollen rise in a warm place about 1 hour or until
double in bulk.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bake Stollen 45 minutes or until golden.
In a small bowl, combine confectioners' sugar with enough of the hot
water to make a thick icing. Dribble icing over hot Stollen; let
Stollen cool before slicing. Makes 1 Stollen.

Christmas Stollen (Quick-Bread Variety)

breads, cakes, holiday

2 1/2 cup flour (all-purpose)
2 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon mace
8 single cardomon seed pods, seeds
1  removed and crushed
3/4 cup almonds, blanched, ground
1/2 cup butter, soft
1 cup cream cheese, softened
1 large egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
2 tablespoon brandy
1/2 cup currants
1/2 cup golden raisins
1/3 cup candied lemon peel, chopped
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup sugar, powdered

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Sift together the flour, baking powder,
sugar, salt, mace, and crushed cardamon seeds. Stir in the ground
almonds. Cut in the soft butter until the mixture looks something
like coarse sand. In a blender, cream the egg with the cream cheese,
vanilla, almond extract, and brandy. Pour it into a bowl and stir in
the dried fruit. Gradually stir in the flour mixture until everything
is is well blended. Work the dough into a ball and turn it out on a
lightly floured board. Knead it for a few minutes until it is smooth,
then place it in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes.  (You can
store the dough in the refrigerator for several days, then take it
out to bake when ever you like.) Shape the dough into a flat, oval
loaf, about 10 inches long and eight inches wide. With the blunt edge
of a knife, crease the loaf about 1/2 inch off center, down the
length of it.  Fold the smaller side of the creased loaf over the
wider side. Brush the top of the folded loaf with the melted butter.
Place the stollen loaf on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for
about 45 minutes, until it starts to turn brown on the outside.
Remove and allow to cool a little bit. Dust lightly with powdered
(i.e., confectioner's) sugar.

Christmas Stollen From Brigitte Sealing

breads, christmas

1 1/8 lb flour
7 oz sugar
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 teaspoon lemon juice
4 tablespoon rum
1 pinch cardomom (generous)
1 pinch mace (generous)
2  eggs
4 1/2 oz butter
4 1/2 oz currants well drained
9 oz sultanas
9 oz almonds, finely chopped
3 1/2 oz candied lemon peel
1 3/4 oz butter for brushing
2 tablespoon powdered sugar for dusting
1 3/4 oz beef drippings
9 oz cottage cheese, well drained

Mix and sieve together the flour and baking powder onto a pastry
board or cool slab. Make a well in the center and pour in the sugar,
vanilla, rum, lemon juice, and the eggs. Draw in some flour from the
sides of the well to mix with these and form a thick paste. Add the
cold butter, cut into small pieces, the finely chopped beef
drippings, cottage cheese, currants, sultanas, nuts and candied peel.
Cover the fruits with more of the flour, and then starting from the
middle, work all of it together quickly with your hands into a firm,
smooth paste. If it should stick, add a little more flour. Form the
mix into a long, oval shape, and then fold it over lengthwise to give
it the traditional "stollen" shape.

Line a baking dish with greased waxed paper and place stollen on this.

Preheat the oven for 5 minutes at 500F. Then bake at a moderately hot
over (375F) for 50-60 minutes. As soon as the stollen comes out of
the oven, brush with melted butter and dust thickly with powdered
sugar.

Christopsomo Tis Kirias Zinis

breads, holiday, greek

4 1/2 cup semolina flour
2 1/4 cup sugar
3 tablespoon freshly ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon freshly ground anise
1 tablespoon freshly ground coriander
2 teaspoon freshly ground cloves
3  oranges
6  tangerines
2 1/2 cup dried currants
1 cup golden raisins
1 cup olive oil, mild
      ----STARTER DOUGH----
4 pkg active dry yeast
1/2 teaspoon sugar hot water, just above body  t; emperature
4 cup all-purpose flour; plus extra for kneading

Make the flavoring addition first.  Combine the semolina flour, sugar,
cinnamon, anise, coriander, and cloves in a bowl and add the finely
grated zests of the oranges and tangerines. Squeeze some of the
oranges and tangerines.  Squeeze some of the oranges and tangerines
to obtain 1 1/4 cups juice.  Use half this juice to soak the currants
and raisins for a minimum of 1 hour, preferably overnight.  Put the
remaining juice in a pan with the olive oil.  Heat until almost
boiling. Pour this into a bowl with the semolina and spice mixture
and stir. Cover and leave overnight until needed. Next day, combine
the dried yeast with the sugar and hot water in a cup. Put the flour
in a bowl, making a well in the center. Pour in the yeast mixture.
Squeeze 2/3 cup more orange and tangerine juice, warm it, nad add.
Work to a smooth dough, adding more water and warm juice if
necessary.  Put the dough into an oiled bowl, cover with a cloth, and
leave to rise in a warm place until almost doubled in size - about an
hour. Punch down the dough in a bowl.  Combine the drained currants
and raisins with the semolina and spice mixture and, working with
your hands, combine with the dough.  Turn the dough onto a floured
surface and knead for 10 minutes, adding more flour if the dough is
sticky. Divide the dough into three equal pieces.  Oil 3 loaf pans,
each 1-1/2 quart capacity. Shape each piece to fit the length of the
pan and fit them in, so the corners are well filled. Cover with a
cloth and leave to rise in a warm place until almost double in size -
another hour. Bake in an oven preheated to 350 F for 1 hour and 10
minutes or more; the loaves should be rich brown color and make a
hollow sound when the unmolded bread is thumped on the bottom. Leave
on a rack to cool.  The bread will keep for at least 3 weeks.

Churek / Flat Armenian Bread With Sesame Seed

breads, dumplings

1 pkg dry yeast
1 tablespoon sugar
2 1/4 cup water -- lukewarm
6 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 lb unsalted butter -- melted
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoon white sesame seeds

Sprinkle the yeast and 1 teaspoon of the sugar into 1/2 cup of
lukewarm (110-115F) water in a small, shallow bowl. Let stand for 2
or 3 minutes, then stir to dissolve the yeast completely. Set the
bowl aside in a warm, draft-free spot (such as an unlighted oven) for
about 5 to 10 minutes, or until the mixture almost doubles in volume.

Pour the flour into a large mixing bowl and make a well in the
center. Pour in the yeast mixture, remaining water, remaining sugar
and salt. With a large spoon beat the flour into the liquid
ingredients, continuing to beat for as long as 10 minutes, or until a
soft, spongy dough is formed. Cover loosely with a kitchen towel and
set aside in the warm, draft-free spot until the mixture doubles in
volume.

Preheat the oven to 350F.  Place the dough on a lightly floured
surface and divide it into 10 equal parts. Roll each part out as
thinly as possible into circles, then place 2 or 3 circles on a
cookie sheet. Sprinkle lightly with cold water and a few sesame seeds
and set the cookie sheet on the floor of the oven. Bake for 20
minutes, or until the bread is a pale golden brown.  Transfer the
breads with a wide spatula to a wire cake rack and bake the remaining
rounds similarly. The bread will keep several days at room
temperature if wrapped securely in foil.

Cinnamon Breakfast Braid

breads, breakfast

3/4 cup warm water
4 tablespoon sugar
1 pkg active dry yeast
2 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cold butter or margarine,
1 single cut into 4 pieces
1 teaspoon salt
1 each egg, beaten
1 single cinnamon sugar
1 each egg white, slightly beaten
1/4 cup sliced almonds

Combine 1/4 cup of the water, 1 tablespoon of the sugar and yeast.
Stir to dissolve yeast and let stand until bubbly, about 5 minutes.
Fit processor with steel blade. Measure flour, butter, remaining
sugar and salt into work bowl.  Process until mixed, about 15
seconds. Turn on processor and very slowly drizzle just enough
remaining water through feed tube into flour mixture so dough forms a
ball that cleans the sides of the bowl. Process until ball turns
around bowl about 25 times. Turn off processor and let dough stand 1
to 2 minutes. Turn on processor and gradually drizzle in enough
remaining water to make dough soft, smooth and satiny, but not
sticky.  Process until dough turns around bowl about 15 times. Turn
dough onto lightly greased surface.  Cover with inverted bowl and let
stand 20 minutes. Prepare Cinnamon Sugar while dough is standing.
Roll out dough into a 9 x 15-inch rectangle.  Cut into three 3 x
15-inch strips. Spoon 1/3 of Cinnamon Sugar lengthwise down center of
each strip. Pull one edge of each strip over Cinnamon sugar to meet
other edge of same strip. Pinch seam to seal. Braid the strips
together to form a loaf. Tuck ends under and pinch to seal.  Place
braid on greased cookie sheet. Brush with beaten egg white and
sprinkle with almonds. Let stand in warm place until doubled, about 1
hour. Heat oven to 375 F.  Bake until evenly brown and loaf sounds
hollow when tapped, 30 - 35 minutes. Remove from cookie sheet and
cool on wire rack. I use only 1 TBS of sugar for the dough and the
Brown Sugar Substitute for the filling...Great for

Cinnamon Nut Biscuits - *P Cooking Class

breads

2 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup vegetable shortening
3/4 cup milk
3 tablespoon melted butter
1/2 cup firmly packed dark brown sug
3/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup chopped pecans

PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 450F. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt
in a large mixing bowl. Cut in the vegetable shortening using a
pastry blender or two knives until the mixture has the consistency of
coarse crumbs. Add the milk, adding more milk if necessary so the
dough is pliable but is still wet. Turn the dough onto a heavily
floured surface, and knead it lightly (8 to 10 times). Do not
overwork the dough. Roll the dough into a rectangle 1/3-inch thick.
Mix the melted butter with the brown sugar, cinnamon and nuts. Press
the mixture into one half of the dough, then fold the dough over to
encase the filling, pressing it lightly to adhere. Cut out biscuits
with a 2-inch round cutter (the diameter of a juice can), dipping the
cutter in flour between cutting each biscuit so they do not stick.
Place the biscuits on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake in the
center of the oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve
immediately, or bake up to 2 hours in advance and reheat for 5
minutes in a 300F oven. Makes 12 to 14. These biscuits are delicious
served warm with sweet butter or apple butter.

Cinnamon Sugar Crusted Sweet Bread

breads

5 cup sifted all purpose flour
2 cup sugar
1  salt
3 tablespoon butter or oil
1  active dry yeast (use 2
1  packages if time is short)
1 cup warm water (105 - 1150f)
1  egg, slightly beaten
1/2 cup melted butter
2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon anise extract or
1/4 cup aniseeds

1.  Sift flour, 1 cup sugar adn salt together.  Cut in the butter
until the mixture resembles coarse meal. If using oil, stir oil into
liquid ingredients after adding the egg.

2.  Dissolve yeast in warm water, stir vigorously, and allow to
ferment for 5 to 10 minutes.  Then add the egg and anise extract or
aniseeds.

3.  Add a small quantity of the flour mixture to the yeast and beat
until thoroughly blended.  Let stand for a few minutes, or until dough
becomes light and airy.

4.  Add the rest of the flour mixture, adding more flour if
necessary to make a stiff dough.  Knead on a lightly floured board
until satiny.

5.  Butter the top of the dough, cover with wax paper and let rise
until doubled.

6.  When the bread has risen, punch it down, and let it rise until
doubled again.

7.  Knead the dough slightly, then form into balls the size of an
orange.  With a rolling pin, flatten to 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick.

8.  Prepare a topping by mixing together the melted butter,
remaining 1 cup sugar and the cinnamon. Spread topping on all sides
of the rolls.

9.  Let rolls rise until light and about doubled in size. When
nearly doubled, preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Bake in a preheated
oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden. Slice thinly and butter
generously with soft butter. Arrange slices on a platter as desired.

2 tablespoon oil
2 cup white flour
2 cup whole-wheat flour
1 teaspoon sea salt
      ----FILLING----
2 tablespoon dark brown sugar

Cinnamon Twist (Basic Sweet Dough)

breads

1/2  recipe basic sweet dough
1 1/2 tablespoon lightly salted butter or margarine,; melted
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/3 cup dark seedless raisins
1/4 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup confectioner's sugar
1 tablespoon warm milk
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Prepare the Basic Sweet Dough.  Lightly grease a baking sheet.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out the Basic Sweet Dough to a
rectangle 14 x 10-inches.  Brush with the melted butter.

Mix the sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over the dough. Sprinkle with the
raisins and walnuts.  Roll up the dough, jelly-roll style, starting
from one long side. Pinch the ends and seam to seal and place the
roll, seam down, on the center of the baking sheet.

With scissors, cut the roll at 1-inch intervals almost through to the
bottom of the roll.  Pull the first slice to the right side and the
next slice to the left side. Continue, alternating to the right and
left. Tuck in any raisins that fall out.  Cover and let rise in a
warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

Heat the oven to 350F.  Bake the coffeecake for 25 to 30 minutes, or
until lightly browned.  Remove from the baking sheet and cool on a
wire rack. While the coffeecake is still warm, mix the confectioners'
sugar with the milk and vanilla; spread over the cake.

Makes one large coffeecake.

NOTE:

For a less sweet coffeecake, omit the confectioners' sugar. Instead,
mix 2 teaspoons of milk with 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar and brush
over the bread as soon as it comes out of the oven.

Classic Sourdough Bread**

breads

1 cup sourdough starter
1 1/3 cup warm water
5  to 6 c all-purpose flour or a combi; nation of
1  all-purpose and whole wheat flours
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda

Cornmeal to sprinkle on pans

THE SPONGE: Pour 1 c of starter into a large ceramic mixing bowl.
Feed and then refrigerate the remainder. Add to the starter in the
mixing bowl, the warm water and about 3 c of flour. Beat vigorously
with a spoon or wire whisk. Cover this sponge with plastic wrap and
put it aside to work. This time period can be very flexible, but
allow at least 2 hours and as many as 24. The longer it has, the more
yeast there will be for the second rise and the more pronounced the
sour flavor of the bread will be.

THE DOUGH: After sponge has bubbled and expanded, remove plastic wrap.
Blend salt, sugar and baking soda into 2 c of flour. Mix this into
sponge with large spoon. When dough begins to hold together, turn it
out onto floured board and knead it for 3 or 4 minutes. Add flour as
needed to make a fairly stiff dough.Give the dough a rest and clean
the bowl. Continue kneading for another 3 or 4 minutes. Place the
dough back in the bowl turning it to grease the top. Cover and let
rise for 2 to 4 hours.If you want, you can skip the second rise in
the bowl and proceed directly to the next step.

SHAPING AND BAKING THE LOAVES: Knock down the dough and shape it into
2 long loaves. Place them on a cornmeal sprinkled cookie sheet, cover
and let them rise for another 2 hours or so.Toward the end of the
rising period, preheat your oven to 450 F and begin heating a kettle
of water on your stove. Just before you put them in the oven, slash
the tops of your loaves diagonally with a knife 1/4" deep every two
inches and brush with cold water.Place a baking pan on the oven

Classical Puff Pastry

breads, baker

1  3  1/2 c  all-purpose flour
1  1  1/2 ts salt
1 lb unsalted butter, cold
1 1/4 cup ice water

Combine the flour and salt in the bowl of a food processor and
process few seconds to combine.  Cut 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) of the
butter into small pieces and process with the flour until there are
no lumps and the mixture is the texture of cornmeal.

Pour half the ice water in a large bowl and turn the flour mixture
onto it. Sprinkle the remaining water over it, reserving one
tablespoon. Transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl, drizzle the
ice water evenly over it and toss like a salad until the dough comes
together in a ragged mass. Add the remaining water if necessary.
Cover in plastic wrap and chill.

Meanwhile, place the remaining butter between layers of plastic wrap
and pound with a rolling pin to make malleable.  Place it between two
sheets of plastic wrap and, using your hands or a rolling pin, shape
it into a 6-inch square.

Remove the dough from the fridge, lightly flour the work surface and,
using either your hands or a rolling pin, shape the mass into 12-inch
square. Place the butter on the dough catty-corner and fold the edges
of the dough into the center to enclose it.

Lightly flour the surface of the dough and roll it into a rectangle
measuring about 12 inches high x 26 inches wide.  If the dough sticks,
loosen it underneath with a long flexible metal palette knife and
scrape off any butter sticking to the work surface.  Brush off any
excess flour. Fold the dough into thirds and turn it 90 degrees, so
that seams are parallel to the table's edge.  This is called a
"turn". Lightly flour and roll it out again to about 12 x 26 inches.
Brush off the excess flour and again fold it into thirds. Place the
dough on a sheet tray, cover it with a plastic bag and refrigerate
for 20 to 30 minutes.

Repeat this, giving the dough two more turns, each time rolling it
out to 12 x 26 inches.  Refrigerate for another 20 or 30 minutes,
then give the dough 2 final turns.  There are six turns in all.

Lightly roll it to flatten and even it.  Wrap it in plastic wrap or a
bag and chill for at least two hours before using it.  It can be kept,
refrigerated, for up to 3 days, or frozen for up to 3 months.

Yield:  2- 3/4 pounds of dough

To roll pastry:  (for home size 11 x 17-inch sheet trays)

For thinly rolled dough (1/16-inch) used to make little pizzas start
with 15 ounces (1/3 of the recipe).  For thickly rolled dough
(3/8-inch) used for everything else, start with 22 ounces (1/2
recipe).

Line an 11 x 17-inch sheet tray with parchment paper.  On a floured
table, roll the rectangle of dough to a length of 15 inches and a
width of 10 inches.  Dust off any excess flour.  Roll the dough up
onto the rolling pin and transfer it to the sheet tray.  Using a
10-inch rolling pin and rolling gently from the center out, roll the
dough to fit the tray. Make sure it is even - with no lumpy edges.
Rolling lightly and gently enables you to keep it even.

Shapes to cut out of the 3/8-inch thick dough:

Bouchee:  Cut 2 (3-1/2-inch) rounds of dough.  Cut a 2-1/4-inch
circle out of the second round.  Egg wash the first round.  Place the
ring from the second round over the first so that the edges line up.
Dock the edges and center with a fork.  Thin inner circle can be
baked as well and used for a lid.

Bouchee made from special cutter:  Use and cutter made especially for
this purpose.  It has two cutting edges - one inside and shorter than
the other that scores, rather than cuts the dough.

Criss-cross Tartlet:  Cut a 5-inch square.  Fold it into a triangle
and cut from each edge towards the apex, stopping about 1/2-inch
short of the apex. The cut should be about 1/2-inch from the edge.
Open it up to the square and place on a cookie sheet.  Egg wash the
edges. Bring one point over to the opposite corner of the inner
square and press. Bring the opposite point over and press.  Press
along the rim to seal. Dock rim and center.

Puff Strip:  From a sheet tray of frozen dough, cut a rectangular
piece 8" wide and the length of the sheet tray.  Transfer it to a
paper lined cookie sheet.  Using a pizza wheel, cut a 3/4" strip from
each edge. Egg wash the edges of the center piece and flip the cut
strips onto the egg washed edge. Dock the 2 rims with a fork, then
dock down the center.

Vol-au-Vent:  Similar to above, but round.  Press whatever size round
you want into the dough on the sheet tray.  Lift and cut along the
circular impression with a pizza wheel.  Center another round, and
inch or so smaller in diameter than the first over the circle of
dough and press lightly.  Remove and cut along this line.  Egg was
the edge, as above, and cut through the outer rim in one place. Place
the rim over the center circle, lining up the edges.  Dock the rim
with a fork, then dock the center.  Bake 20 to 25 minutes in a
preheated 425 degree F. oven.

Clootie Dumpling

breads

6 oz plain flour
3 oz shredded suet (usually available at; your butcher)
3 oz currants (dark raisins)
1 oz sultanas (white raisins)
2 oz to 3 oz castor sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup buttermilk or sour milk

Mix flour with suet, fruit, sugar, cinnamon and soda. Stir in enough
milk to make a soft batter. Dip a pudding cloth (cheesecloth) into
boiling water, sink it in a basin large enough to hold the batter.
Dredge it lightly with flour and spoon in the batter. Draw the
fullness of the cloth together evenly, then tie it tightly with
string, but leave enough room for the dumpling to swell. Place a
saucer or plate in the bottom of a large saucepan. Lift the dumpling
into the pan. Pour in enough boiling water to cover. Simmer for a
full 2 hours, then untie. Turn out carefully onto a hot serving dish.
Dredge with castor sugar. Serve with hot custard sauce. Yields 4 to 6
servings.

For the hot custard sauce, we usually use Byrd's Custard. If you have
the availability of British goods in your area, they should have
Byrd's custard. It comes in a large tin, like a container of powdered
chocolate for chocolate milk. Just follow the directions to make a
custard, only dilute it a little more to make it sauce-like.

Coffee Crunch Cake

breads, cakes

1 1/2 cup sugar; plus...
2 tablespoon sugar
1/4 cup strong coffee
1/4 cup light corn syrup
1 tablespoon soda; sifted
1  (10-in.) angel food cake
2 cup whipping cream
2 teaspoon vanilla

Combine 1 1/2 cups sugar, coffee and corn syrup in saucepan at least 5
inches deep. Bring mixture to boil and cook to 310F on candy
thermometer or hard-crack stage (small amount of mixture dropped into
cold water will break with brittle snap). Remove syrup from heat,
immediately add soda and stir vigorously just until mixture thickens
and pulls away from sides of pan. (Mixture will foam rapidly when
soda is added. Do not destroy foam by excessive beating.) Immediately
pour foamy mass into ungreased 9-inch square metal pan (do not spread
or stir). Let stand without moving until cool. When ready to garnish
cake, knock hardened mixture out of pan and crush between sheets of
waxed paper with rolling pin to form coarse crumbs. Split cake into 4
equal layers. Combine cream, remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and
vanilla in chilled bowl and beat until stiff. Spread about 1/2 of
cream between layers and remainder over top and sides of cake.
Sprinkle generously with crushed topping. Refrigerate until ready to
serve.

1  jim vorheis
3 tablespoon yellow corn meal
12 oz can coors beer
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon salt
1 pkg dry yeast
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon honey
2 cup bread flour
1 1/2 cup rye flour
1 1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds
1/4 cup bread flour
1  filling:
1/2 cup thousand island dressing
16 oz sauerkraut, drained
1/2 lb corned beef, thinly sliced
1/2 lb swiss cheese, thinly sliced

IN medium saucepan, combine corn meal and beer.  Heat to boiling and
simmer for 2 minutes.  Stir in butter and salt. Cool to 105-115 F.
Stir in yeast, sugar and honey and let stand for 5 minutes. Pour
mixture into large mixing bowl and add 2 cups of bread flour,
stirring until well blended. Add rye flour and caraway seeds and mix

of remaining 1/4 cup bread flour to reduce stickiness and make dough
workable. Place dough in oiled bowl and turn to coat all sides. Let
rise until doubled in bulk.

Punch dough down and let rest for 10 minutes.  Divide dough in half,
covering one piece.  On a floured surface, roll other piece into
rectangle not longer than baking sheet. Trim dough so that rectangle
is a true shape. Lightly score dough into thirds lengthwise. Spread
1/2 dressing over the center third, leaving 1 inch at top and bottom
of section uncovered. Cover dressing with 1/2 sauerkraut, 1/2 corned
beef and 1/2 cheese. Fold 1 inch at top and bottom over filling and
pinch to seal. On each side of filling, make cuts at 1-inch
intervals. Cuts begin 1/2 inch from filling and go to outer edges.
Beginning on right, pull top strip across middle and seal end on
other side of filling. Pull top left strip across middle and seal;
alternate in braiding fashion until all strips are secured. Repeat
with other ball of dough. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes. Place on
greased baking sheet and bake at 350 F for 30 minutes. Slice to serve.

Corn Biscuits

desserts, quick bread

1/2 cup butter, softened -- at room
1  temperature
1/2 cup sugar
1 cup yellow cornmeal
2  eggs at room temperature
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour (approx)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.  Stir the butter into a soft
mass; slowly add sugar, blending together well. Add cornmeal, eggs,
and salt. Beat until the mixture is smooth; add 1-1/4 c. flour (the
mixture will be soft and moist).  Roll the dough out to 1/4"
thickness; if the dough is too sticky to roll, add 1/4 c. flour and
blend into the top of the dough with your hands (I find it's also
easier if you roll out on a lightly floured board).  Cut out 4 dozen
1-1/2" rounds with a cookie cutter (I've also used squares, etc. --
whatever cutters I had handy at the time). Place close together on a
lightly greased baking sheet, but don't let them touch. Bake on
center shelf for about 22 minutes or until biscuits are just starting
to turn slightly brown around the edges. Near the end of this baking
period turn the baking sheet around for even cooking. If the biscuits
near the outer edges of the sheet are browning too fast then just
remove them if they're done or rearrange the biscuits on the sheet so
the brown-er ones get moved to the center. Remove biscuits from the
oven and cool on a rack. These are wonderful served warm; they freeze
very well and can be warmed up when ready to serve.

If not freezing them, keep at room temperature in an airtight
container. Kept this way the biscuits will last up to 10-14 days.

These biscuits are terrific served with coffee or tea, or with a dish
of fresh fruit.  They are slightly sweet with a wonderful, grainy
texture due to the cornmeal in the recipe. They're quite addictive.

(makes 4 dozen, but they don't last long!)

Corn Bread (Barry)

breads, barry

14 oz strong plain flour
10 oz medium yellow corn meal not corn fl; our
2 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon baking powder
8 fl oz milk
4 tablespoon sunflower or soya oil
2 tablespoon natural yoghurt
      ----OPTIONAL----
8 oz grated cheddar cheese

Grease a 2 pound loaf tin and heat the oven to gas mark 5,375F,190C.
Place the flour, corn meal, sugar and baking powder into a bowl, and
beat in the eggs, milk, oil and yoghurt. Mix all the liquids together
first if you like, then pour them in. Give the mixture a good stir.
At this point you could add 8 ounces of grated Cheddar Cheese or
similar. Pour into the tin and bake for 55 minutes. Test with a
skewer - if it comes out clean it's ready, if it's a bit smeary it
needs another 5 to 10 minutes, but cover the top with foil to stop
the crust burning. Remove when ready and let it stand for five
minutes before turning out. You may find a knife round the edge helps

Corn Bread From Scratch

breads, crockpot

      ----DEIDREANNE PENRODFGGT98B----
1 1/4 cup flour
3/4 cup yellow cornmeal
1/4 cup granulated sugar
4 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1  egg; slightly beaten
1 cup milk
1/3 cup butter; melted ---or----
1/3 cup vegetable oil

Corn Bread from Scratch 2 to 3 hours

Corn bread mix is so successful you really don't need to make it from
scratch, but it costs more than a hand-mixed version. I grease the
mold for corn bread with bacon drippings.

To Cook: In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cornmeal, sugar,
baking powder, and salt. Make a well in the center. Turn the egg,
milk, and melted butter or oil into the well and beat into the dry
mixture until just moistened. Turn into a greased 2-quart mold, cover
with a plate, and place on a trivet or rack in the bottom of the slow
cooker. Cover the cooker, cook on high for 2 to 3 hours. Makes 6
servings.

Corn Bread Ii

breads, cajun

2 cup corn meal
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon soda
2 cup buttermilk
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
2  eggs, beaten

Prepare large cast iron skillet:  grease generously with bacon
drippings so that bottom of skillet is well covered. Place skillet in
400 F. oven to heat. Meanwhile prepare batter: Combine dry
ingredients, add eggs and butter milk, mixing well.  Remove skillet
from oven when grease starts to smoke; scrape batter into skillet.
Batter must start to sizzle as soon as it hits skillet.  Place in
oven and continue baking for 20-25 minutes, or until browned on top.
I don't use this skillet for anything but corn bread and I never wash
it, just wipe out well. After a few times you will find the corn
bread will fall out of pan easily and intact. Courtesy Telephone

Corn Chips

appetizers, breads

1 cup warm (100 f.) water
1  egg yolk
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup masa harina, or as needed
1  corn oil for frying

In a mixing bowl, whisk the water, egg yolk and salt together until
thoroughly mixed. Gradually add enough masa to make a soft dough, just
stiff enough not to stick to your fingers.

In a heavy skillet, deep fryer, or elec. skillet preheat oil to at
least 375 F.

Fit a cookie press or pastry bag with the plate or tip designed to
make a flat, ribbed shape and fill it with the masa dough. Press out
into the hot oil a few short lengths of dough, enough to cover only
about half the surface of the oil.  Fry ribbons turning once, just
until golden brown. Remove with slotted spoon or skimmer and drain on
paper towels.

Serve chips while still warm, or cool completely and store airtight.
To serve chips after storage, freshen briefly in warm oven. Will keep
for up to one week.

Masa flour, made from specially processed corn, has a taste all its
own. Cornmeal CANNOT be substituted. Chips can be made in double or
triple batches and are so quick they can be made on very short notice.

Corn Muffins (Samuel)

breads, vegetarian

2 cup corn flour or cornmeal  (yellow or; blue)
1 cup whole wheat pastry flour
6 oz soft tofu
3 cup water
1/2 teaspoon salt (sea salt in book)

Mix flours. Crumble tofu into blender.  Add boiled water and salt to
tofu in blender (carefully) and blend until not quite smooth. (Just a
few pulses please). Dont do this in too small blender or without lid
like I did once. The goal is muffins, not 2nd degree burns. Add
immediately to flour and mix well. Spoon into muffin tins or cast
iron stick trays and bake at 400 degrees for about 1/2 hour until
golden brown. She suggests you heat oven first and place oiled muffin
tins in to heat up beforehand to get a "wonderful crust".

Please note, I have to oil the tins because I don't use teflon
products around by birds, but this might work also.....This is not
sweet bread, I serve corn potato chowder with it. The corn sticks are
better!

1  med onion coarsely chopped
2 cup rye flour
1 3/4 cup warm water
1 pkg yeast
1/2 tablespoon caraway seeds
      ----BREAD----
2 cup rye sour
1/4 cup water
1/2 pkg dry yeast
1/2 tablespoon salt
2 cup bread flour
1/2  egg
1/2 tablespoon caraway seeds

For the starter: Put onions in cheese cloth.  Mix remaining
ingredients, submerge cheese cloth into it, and let sit overnight (in
bread pan). In the morning, remove the onions. There should be 2 cups
of starter in the pan -- just what we need. Add remaining ingredients
~- use up to 1/4 cup more flour if needed to get the dough ball to
the right consistency. Also the 1/4 cup water should be added slowly,
using judgment. About 20 minutes before baking slash the top and

Corn Sticks

breads, southern

2  eggs
2 cup buttermilk
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon soda
2 cup sifted white corn meal
3 tablespoon melted shortening
1 teaspoon salt
3 teaspoon baking powder

Beat eggs together until light.  Add milk, shortening and salt.  Add
meal, being careful in putting in, as meal varies and the batter
should be a medium batter.  Beat smooth.  Grease and heat stick pans.
Sift in the baking powder and dissolve the soda in a spoonful of cold
water. Add to the mixture, stir well and pour into molds.  Bake in
good hot oven until brown and crusty--about 15 to 20 minutes.  Corn
sticks need a batter some thinner than muffins.

Corn Tortillas (Aha)

breads, mexican, heartright

1 1/2 cup water
1 1/2 tablespoon acceptable margarine
1 cup stone-ground cornmeal
1 1/2 tablespoon acceptable margarine
1 1/4 cup whole-wheat flour
1 teaspoon salt

Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan.  Add 1 1/2 T margarine.
Stir in cornmeal quickly, then immediately lower heat and cover pan.
Let cornmeal cook over very low heat for 5 minutes.  Stir in
remaining margarine and set aside to cool.

Mix flour and salt.  Stir in cooled cornmeal and knead, adding water
or more flour if necessary to form a soft dough.  Pinch off twelve
pices and roll into 2-inch balls.

Flatten each ball between palms or against a board, making a flat
circle. Roll with rolling pin to 6-7 inches.  Keep turning the circle
to keep it round, and sprinkle board and pin with cornmeal as needed
to prevent sticking.

Cook on a hot ungreased griddle for 1 1/2 minutes on each side, or
until flecked with dark spots.

Line a basket or bowl with a large cloth.  Stack tortillas in bowl
and keep covered with cloth.

They may be made up to a day in advance.  Heating for a few seconds
on each side makes them soft and pliable for handling again.  Heat
them on a griddle or directly over a medium gas flame.

Corn Tortillas (Making)

breads, world

      ----FOR 16 TORTILLAS----
1 1/2 cup masa harina
1/2 cup cornmeal
1 1/2 tablespoon oil
1 1/3 cup warm water

Mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl and beat with a
wooden spoon until thick and smooth. Scrape the sides of the bowl,
and cover the surface of the dough with plastic wrap while pressing
and frying individual tortillas so the dough will not dry out. To
form the tortillas, wet your hands and pull off a lump of dough about
the size of a golfball. Roll it into a ball. Tear off 2 pieces of
plastic wrap about a foot long. Either in a tortilla press, or
between 2 dinner plates, place the ball between the sheets of plastic
wrap. Press down with the palm of your hand to flatten slightly, then
press firmly to form a thin circle. Use the first tortilla to test
the consistency of the dough. If the edges of the tortilla are uneven
and crumbly, the dough needs a little more water. If the sheet of
plastic sticks to the dough and it is very soft, add a few
tablespoons of masa harina. Repeat with the remaining dough, leaving
individual tortillas between the sheets of plastic wrap. Heat a heavy
skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Peel off the top sheet of
plastic and invert the tortilla into the hot pan. Grill until
stiffened, about 30 seconds; turn for 1 minute or less, until the
side is slightly browned, then turn to the first side for 30 seconds.
The time for grilling each tortilla is less than 2 minutes. Repeat
with the remaining tortillas. Source: SouthWest Tastes

Corn Tortillas/Chips

breads, mexican

1 1/2 cup masa harina *
2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon vegetable shortening
1 1/4 cup water

* Masa harina -    A flour made from dried corn, which is combined
with liquid and used to make corn tortillas and tamales. Masa harina
is available in many grocery stores and may be stored in an airtight
containers or in a freezer. In a medium bowl, stir together the masa
harina and salt.  In a small saucepan over high heat, bring the lard
of shortening and water to a boil and stir until melted.  Pour this
liquid into the masa harina and blend well with a fork or pastry
blender. Knead on a lightly floured board until smooth, about 5
minutes.

Divide the dough into 12 pieces and roll each into a ball about 1
inch in diameter.  Roll out the dough between pieces of parchment or
waxed paper until the dough is paper thin and about 6 inches in
diameter.

Heat a large cast iron or other heavy skillet over high heat until
very hot.  Remove a circle of dough from the paper and place it in
the hot skillet.  Cook until brown on one side, about 30 seconds,
turn and brown the other side.  Keep warm in a cloth towel. Repeat
until all the tortillas are made.

TORTILLA CHIPS

Cut tortilla into 8 wedges; set aside.  Pour oil into a heavy
saucepan or skillet to a depth of 1 inch Over medium high heat, heat
to a temperature of 375 degrees F, or until a tortilla chips browns
in 60 seconds.

Drop the tortilla wedges into the hot oil in batches and cook for 1
to 2 minutes, or until they turn golden. Drain on paper towels. Let
cool and store in airtight containers.

Cornbread

breads

1 cup white flour
1 cup corn flour or fine cornmeal
2 tablespoon sugar
2 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2  eggs
1 cup milk
2 tablespoon melted butter

This batter can also be baked in muffin cups as well as in a loaf pan.
Either way, it's good.

PREHEAT OVEN TO 400F. Combine the white flour, corn flour or cornmeal,
sugar, baking powder and salt. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs;
then stir in the milk and the butter. Pour the wet ingredients into
the dry ones and stir just enough to combine, in about 15-or-16
strokes. Overmixing causes the cornbread to be tough. Pour into a
buttered baking pan and bake until the cornbread is firm and a
toothpick comes out clean, about 30 minutes.

Cornucopia

breads, holiday, christmas, easter

3 can soft-breadstick dough
1 large egg, beaten with:
1 tablespoon water
      ----ASSORTED RAW VEGETABLES----
1  sugar snap peas, red and
1  yellow cherry tomatoes,
1  baby carrots, baby squash,
1  cauliflower and broccli
1  floretts.

1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Lightly spray a cookie sheet, at
least 17"x 14", with non-stick cooking spray.

2. Tear off a 30"x 18" sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil. Fold in 1/2
to 18"x 15".  Roll diagonally to form a hollow cone, about 18" long
with a diameter of 5" at the widest end (Cornucopia opening). Fasten
end with clear tape.  Stuff cone with crumpled regular foil until
form is rigid. Bend tail of cone up then down at end. Spray outside
of cone with non-stick cooking spray.  Place on cookie sheet.

3.  Open and unroll first  can of breadstick dough on work surface.
Seperate breadsticks.  Begin by wraping one breadstick around tip of
cone. Brush end of next breadstick with Glaze and press to attach to
end of first breadstick.  Continue spiral-wrapping cone, slightly
overlapping dough until there are 3 breadsticks left.

4.  Pinch one end of the 3 breadsticks together, then braid. Brush
bread around opening of Cornucopia with Glaze. Gently press on braid.
Brush entire Cornucopia with Glaze.

5.  Bake 45 minutes in preheated oven or until bread is a rich brown.
(If parts start to darken too much, cover them with poeces of foil.)

6.  Remove from oven and let cool completely on cookie sheet on a wire
rack.  Carefully remove foil when cool. (If freezing, leave foil in
bread for support. Remove when thawed.)

7.  Fill Cornucopia with the assorted raw vegetables directly on
table and let them spill out of opening

NOTE-- To prevent this center-piece from absorbing atmospheric
moisture, the baked Cornucopia cone can be sprayed with shellac or
clear enamel. If treated in this manner, the Cornucopia will be
inedible but can be preserved and re-used.

1/4  to 1/2 cup warm water
2 tablespoon sugar
1 pkg active dry yeast
2 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon instant minced onions
1 tablespoon butter or margarine
2 teaspoon dried dill weed
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup creamed cottage cheese, room temper; ature
1  egg, beaten

Makes 1 loaf

Vegetable oil or melted butter or margarine

Combine 1/4 cup of the water, sugar and yeast.  Stir to dissolve
yeast and let stand until bubbly, about 5 minutes.

Fit processor with steel blade.  Measure flour, onions, butter, dill
weed, salt and soda into work bowl. Process until mixed, about 15
seconds.

Add yeast mixture to flour mixture.  Process until blended, about 10
seconds.

through feed tube into flour mixture so dough forms a ball that
cleans the sides of the bowl. Process until ball turns around bowl
about 25 times. Turn off processor and let dough stand 1 to 2 minutes.

Turn on processor and gradually drizzle in just enough remaining
water to make dough soft, smooth and satiny but not sticky. Process
until dough turns around bowl about 15 times.

Turn dough onto lightly greased surface.  Shape into a ball and place
in lightly greased bowl, turning to grease all sides. Cover loosely
with plastic wrap and let stand in warm place until doubled, about 1
hour.

Punch down dough.  Shape into smooth ball and place on greased cookie
sheet.  Roll or pat dough into a circle about 8 inches in diameter.
Brush with oil and let stand in warm place until almost doubled,
about 45 minutes.

Heat oven to 350 F.  Bake until evenly brown, 35 - 45 minutes.

Country Ham & Hominy Bread X Two

breads

1 1/3 cup warm water; 110/115f degree
4 tablespoon honey
4 pkg active dry yeast
8 cup bread flour; or less
1 cup cornmeal; not cornmeal mix
1 1/3 cup whole wheat flour
      ----FILLING FOR DOUGH----
1/2 cup country ham; minced and fried until cr
1 large onion; white, 1/4 dice
1/3 cup chile pulp; anaheim, seenote
6 tablespoon molasses
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1  egg; lightly beaten
1  14oz can of yellow hominy
2 tablespoon oat bran; dust on top

seenote: Dried Chiles, reconstitute 6 to 8 Anaheim or Numex Peppers,
scrape the flesh from the inside of the skin, discard the skin. using
a sturdy fork mash the pulp until smooth. Use any other method for
mashing chiles. NOTE,NOTE,    Use only recipe amount of this mixture.
seenote: Hominy, drain 14 oz. can of hominy, rinse slightly and chop
a little. Until the hominy is in 1/3 hominy size.....
Lightly grease a baking sheet. Sprinkle with 1 tb cornmeal. Set
aside.
Chop the Ham and Onion separately, into small dice or large mince,
fry the ham in a dry hot pan to crisp the edges of the ham. Remove
ham from pan.
Add onions to the same pan, stir over medium heat for 8 to 10
minutes. Cook the Onions until golden brown, DO NOT brown until
crisp. Mikenote: Pay attention to stirring at this step. NO crisping.
Combine onions, ham, and hominy and stir to mix well, let this cool.
In a 4 cup measuring cup, stir the honey into the water and sprinkle
the yeast on top, stir until dissolved. Set aside.
Use the dough hook for this project. In the mixing bowl of a heavy
duty stand mixer, combine bread flour, 1 cup of cornmeal, whole wheat
flour, molasses, vegetable oil, salt and egg. mix on low speed for 1
minute. Add the water/honey/yeast mix, Onion, chopped Hominy, Ham,
Chili Pulp, and enough of the remaining flour to form a soft dough.
Mix on low speed for 2 minutes. Knead on low speed, adding additional
flour as needed, for 8-10 minutes or until the dough is smooth and
elastic and no longer sticky.
Cover the mixing bowl and let rise until doubled, 1 to 2 hours.
I usually freeze half of this dough for a later loaf. Divide dough
into two balls, freeze in a non stick sprayed, gallon plastic bag.
Continue this recipe with remaining dough.
Punch down the dough on a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough
into a 14" circle, fold it in half, overlapping, slightly off center,
so the top layer is set back about 1" from the bottom edge. With a
sharp knife,or dough scraper, make 4 or 5 equally spaced cuts from
curved edge to folded edge, about 2/3 the way across the loaf
(cutting through both layers). Separate the cuts slightly so the loaf
opens up and is crescent shaped. Place on the prepared baking sheet
and let rise until doubled in volume, about 45
minutes...............Preheat the oven to 375F degrees.
Let rise in warm room for 45 minutes, place in 375F degree oven for
45 minutes, or until it is nicely brown on top and the interior
temperature is 200+F degrees.
Remember this bread is fairly wet, and it will go against some of the
rules of breadmaking. Use a flour sifter/duster to lightly flour the
dough on the board if it seems too sticky to handle.
Brush the loaf with the melted butter and sprinkle the remaining 1
tb of Oat bran over the loaf. Bake for 40 minutes or until done.
Remove to a wire rack and let cool completely.

Cracked Wheat Bread (Cannon)

breads

2 cup warm milk
1 cup wheat bran cereal (all-bran, fiber; 1, or 100% bran)
1/2 cup warm water
2 tablespoon yeast
1/3 cup honey
2 tablespoon olive oil or vegetable oil
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup cracked wheat
3 cup whole wheat flour
2 1/2 cup to 3 1/2 c bread flour (or all purp; ose flour)

In a large bowl, add wheat bran cereal to milk and soak 15-30 minutes.
Proof yeast in warm water.

Add yeast mixture, honey, olive oil, salt, and cracked wheat to milk
mixture and mix well. Add the whole wheat flour, one cup at a time,
mixing well after each addition. Then add bread flour 1/2 c at a
time, mixing well after each addition. When dough gets very stiff,
turn out onto a well-floured surface and knead in enough remaining
flour to make a good soft dough.

Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let
rise until doubled. Punch down, divide in half, and form each half
into a loaf and place in a 8.5x4.5 inch or 9x5 inch bread pan and
cover. Let rise until doubled in bulk.

Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 30 minutes, remove from pans
and continue to bake for another 10-15 minutes until bread sounds
hollow on bottom. May need to cover tops with aluminum foil during
final 10-15 minutes of baking if top is browning too much. Let cool
on racks before slicing.

Shape dough into 16 thin patties, placing1 atop another forming 8
biscuits in greased 9" round baking pan. Bake at 450~ 16 to 18

round. Place close together in greased round baking pan. Wipetops in
soft butter. Bake 450~ 18 minutes or until brown. Cool 10 minutes

Cracker Tips

breads, crackers

1 each hints and tips

Here are a few tips for baking your own crackers: 1. If you have
cracker dough stored in the freezer, it's like money
in the bank for spur-of-the-moment entertaining. 2. Baking sheets
lined with parchment paper make easy work of
cleanup. 3. Keep an eye on the oven because baking time may vary
with each
batch, depending on the heat and placement of the sheets. 4.
Crackers store well in airtight containers, but last even better
if frozen. 5. Homemade crackers usually are not as crispy as
commercial
varieties.  If they get a little limp hours or days after baking,
revive them by heating in a 275 degree oven. 6. To reheat or crisp
crackers, bake on ungreased cookie sheet at 350
degrees for 3-4 minutes.

Cranberry Sweet Bread

breads

1/2 cup nonfat milk
1/2 cup + 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar
1  envelope yeast
1/4 cup warm water, 105-115 degrees
1/4 cup nonfat egg substitute equivalent to; 1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 1/2  to 3 cups flour
1 cup cranberries, coarse chopped
2 teaspoon melted butter

Heat milk and 1/2 cup sugar in saucepan to scalding, then cool to
lukewarm. Combine yeast and warm water in mixing bowl, stirring until
yeast is dissolved. Add cooled milk mixture to yeast mixture in
mixing bowl. Stir in egg substitute, vanilla and salt.  Beat in 1 cup
flour. Beat in enough remaining flour to make soft dough. 	Knead
about 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Put dough into greased
bowl. Let rise in warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
	Sprinkle 2 tablespoons sugar over chopped cranberries.  Let stand
while bread rises. Drain excess liquid off cranberries.  Knead
cranberries into dough. Shape into round. Spray baking sheet with
non-stick cooking spray, or grease lightly. Place dough round on
baking sheet. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.
Brush top of bread with butter. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2
tablespoon sugar. Bake at 375 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes, until
golden brown. Let cool to warm. Makes 8 servings.

Notes:

1. It is important to let the milk and sugar mixture cool completely
before adding it to the yeast.  Or else you will kill the yeast and
end up with flat bread.

2. If after draining the liquid from the cranberries and kneading in
the dough is moist and sticky, just add a little more flour.

Crisp Potato Flatbread

breads

1 large baking potato; unpeeled
1/2 cup milk; heated to 110 degrees
1 pkg active dry yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
1  egg
3 tablespoon butter; softened
1 1/2 cup bread flour
3 tablespoon rosemary; chopped
1  olive oil
1  coarse kosher salt

:       Preheat the oven to 400d.
Prick the potato all over with a fork and bake in the oven for one
hour or until soft.
Remove from the oven, peel and mash the potato until smooth with the
paddle attachment of a heavy duty stand mixer.
Allow to cool.
Meanwhile, in a measuring cup, whisk together the milk, yeast, and
sugar.
Proof the yeast for 10 minutes until very foamy with the egg and
softened butter.
Gradually beat in the flour and the rosemary until smooth. The
mixture will be more like a batter than a dough.
Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature
until the dough doubles in volume, about 1 hour.
Stir down with a wooden spoon, cover and refrigerate overnite.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Lightly oil or spray a 13" by 9"
baking sheet. Using oiled hands spread the dough evenly over the
sheet.
Set aside until doubled, about 45 minutes.
Drizzle with a little olive oil and the salt.
Bake for 25 minutes or until golden.
Cut into wedges and serve.

Crock Pot Quick Breads & Cakes (Info)

breads, crockpot

1  set of instructions
1  breads & cake

:    There are a few tricks to remember when "baking" in one of these
pots. First, turn the control to HIGH (or to the setting which is
equivalent to the HIGH used in the recipes). The LOW setting is too
low to give breads and cakes the texture you expect. :
With breads, remember to cover the container with a lid or foil.
Tie the lid or foil onto the container and place the container on a
meal rack or trivet inside the pot. If you don't have a metal rack or
trivet to fit your slow cooker, crumple foil and place it in the
bottom of the pot to support the baking container. Pour 2 cups of hot
water around the container to provide steam for cooking the bread. :
When using a deep fryer type of slow cooker, check frequently to
make sure the water hasn't evaporated. Add more water if needed.
:    In general, it is not a good idea to remove the lid or foil from
the bread container during the first 2 hours of cooking. After that,
check the bread by inserting a toothpick in the mixture. If the
toothpick comes out clean, the bread is done.
:    When using a standard cake mix, the procedure is slightly
different. Cakes are "baked" in a pan set directly on the bottom of
the slow cooker, similar to the way you would do it in an oven.  [You
do??? --KL] :    It is not necessary to use a trivet or water.
Instead of covering the uncooked cake mixture with foil or a lid,
cover the top with four or five layers of paper towels.  Because
there is more mosture in a slow cooker than in an oven, it is
necessary to compensate for this with the paper towels to help absorb
the moist top of the cake mix. Also, leave the lid of your slow
cooker slightly open to let extra moisture escape. :    The type and
kind of container to use for breads and cakes will depend on the size
of your pot. The following containers hold equivalent amounts of
batter, and so will substitute for each other:

Coffee can, 2 lb                two coffee cans, 1 lb Mole, 6-7 cup
capacity          baking dish, 1 1/2 quart Three vegetable cans, 16 oz

Souffle dishes and springform pans also work, when they fit in the
pot.

withstand the heat.  Do NOT use coffee or vegetable cans as most
contain lead and are painted or sealed with materials that may give
off toxic gases when heated.

Taken from "Better Homes and Gardens New Crockery Cooker"

This recipe doesn't say you can seal them up and store them in your
pantry but my Kerr Canning book recipe says you can; here's how:

Remove jars from the oven one at a time, wipe rim of jar clean; put
on lid and ring and screw on tightly.

Jars will seal as the cake cools.  Store like canned goods.

If you'll be giving these as gifts, take a piece of decorative cloth
(about 1-inch larger in circumference than the lid or as large as
you'd like) and put it on top of the lid, then screw on the ring.
Make sure you screw the lid on very tightly. I like to use pinking
shears to cut the cloth out with.

Croissants

breads

1 cup milk
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 pkg dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water
2 1/2 cup unbleached flour
1 cup butter; cold

COMBINE MILK, first amount of butter, sugar and salt in a small pot
and bring to a boil over high heat. Immediately remove from the heat
and let stand to room temperature. In the meantime, dissolve the
yeast in the water and add it to the milk. Place the liquid in a
mixer and add the flour. Using the dough hook, mix until the dough is
elastic. It will be sticky. Place in a bowl, cover and let rise until
double in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Place in refrigerator and chill
for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, soften the remaining cold butter by
pounding with a rolling pin. Roll the dough on a floured board to
form a 1/4-inch thick rectangle. Spread the butter over 2/3 of the
rectangle closest to you. Fold the unbuttered third over the center
third. Then fold the bottom 1/3 over the doubled portion. Swing the
dough around a quarter turn, that is, bring east to south. Roll it
again into a 1/4-inch thick oblong. Fold again in thirds. Cover the
dough and place in the refrigerator for 2 hours. When the dough is
chilled, remove from the refrigerator and repeat the folding and
turning twice more. Then roll the dough to 1/4-inch thickness again.
Cut the dough into 3-inch squares and cut the squares on the bias to
form two triangles. Roll each triangle beginning with the wide side,
then shape the rolls into crescents. Chill for 30 minutes in the
refrigerator before baking. Preheat oven to 400F. Bake for 10
minutes. Reduce heat to 350F and continue to bake another 15 minutes.

Croissants (Kh)

breads

1 cup milk
1 tablespoon oil
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pkg compressed or active dry
1  yeast
1/4 cup warm water (105 to 115)
2 3/4  to 3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup (1/2 pound) butter,
1  softened
1  egg yolk
1 tablespoon milk

Heat 1 cup milk, oil, sugar, and salt in a saucepan; cool to lukewanm.
Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Add milk mixture and 1
cup flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to make
a soft dough. Turn dough onto a floured surface; continue to work in
flour until dough can be kneaded. Knead until smooth and elastic
(about 5 minutes). Shape dough into a ball and place in an oiled
bowl; turn to oil top of dough. Cover; let rise in a warm place until
double in bulk (about 45 minutes). Punch dough down. Roll out on
floured surface to form a rectangle about l/4 inch thick. Cut butter
in slices (just soft enough to spread but not melted). Spread over
center one-third section of rectangle. Fold each extending side of
butter, pressing together the open edges to seal. Roll out again
until rectangle is 3/8 inch thick. Turn dough occasionally, flouring
surface lightly to prevent sticking. Fold in thirds again to make a
squarish rectangle. Roll dough and fold again in the same manner.
Wrap dough in waxed paper or foil; chill 30 minutes. If at any time
dough oozes butter and becomes sticky while rolling, chill until
butter is more firm. Roll and fold again 2 more times exactly as
directed before. Chill dough again another 30 minutes. Roll dough
into a rectangle about 1/8 inch thick. Cut into strips 6 inches wide.
Cut triangles out of each strip to measure about 6x8x6 inches. Roll
up each triangle of dough from a 6-inch edge, pinching tip to seal.
Shape each roll into a crescent. Place, point down, 1 1/2 inches
apart on ungreased baking sheet. Cover; let rise until double in bulk
(30 to 45 minutes). Brush each roll with mixture of egg yolk and 1
tablespoon milk. Bake at 425F 15 minutes, or until brown. Remove from
baking sheet and cool on wire rack. Serve warm.

Crumpets & Muffins (English)

breads

1 quart water
2 oz yeast
1/2 lb potatoes
1/2 oz salt
1  flour

MUFFINS: Wash, peel & boil the potatoes, rub through a colander, add
the water (just warm enough to bear the hand in it without
discomfort); then dissolve the yeast & salt in it, & stir in
sufficient flour to make a moist paste. Beat it well in a deep bowl &
then clear off the paste from the hands; cover over with a clean
cloth & leave it to rise in a warm place. When it has well risen, &
is light & spongy, turn it out on the table, dredge over with flour,
& then divide it off into pieces about 3 oz in weight, roll them up
into round shapes, & set them on a wooden tray, well dusted with
flour to prove. When light enough, see that the hot plate is hot, &
then carefully transfer the muffins from the tray, one at a time,
using a thin tin slice for the purpose, taking particular care not to
knock out the proof or the muffins will be spoilt. When they have
been properly cooked on one side, turn over with the slice & cook the
other side. When the muffins are done, brush off the flour, & lay
them on a clean clothe or sieve to cool. To toast them, divide the
edge of the muffin all round by pulling it open to the depth of about
1 inch with the fingers. Put it on a toasting fork & hold it before a
clear fire till one side is nicely browned, but not burnt; turn, &
toast it on the other. Do not toast them too quickly, otherwise the
middle of the muffin will not be warmed through. When done, divide
them by pulling them open; butter them slighlty on both sides, put
them together again, & cut them into halves. Pile on a hot dish &
send quickly to table. Time: 25 to 30 minutes to bake. Sufficient for
about 2 dozen muffins. CRUMPETS: Proceed exactly the same as directed
for Muffins (above), but stir in only half the quantity of flour used
for them, so that the mixture is more of a batter than a sponge.
Cover over, & leave for 1/2 an hour. At the end of that time take a
large wooden spoon & well beat up the batter, leave in the spoon,
cover over, & leave for another 1/2 an hour. Then give the batter
another good beat up. This process must be repeated 3 times with the
intervals. When completed, see that the hot plate is quite hot, lay
out some crumpet rings rubbed over inside with a little clean lard on
a baking tin, & pour in sufficient of the batter to make the
crumpets. When cooked on one side, turn over with a palette-knife, &
when done take off on to a clean cloth to cool. Muffins & crumpets
should always be served on separate dishes, & both toasted & served
as quickly as possible. Time: about 20 minutes to cook. Sufficient
for about 2 dozen crumpets.

rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk.  Butter a 1 1/2 quart
casserole dish and stir the dough down, then add 1 cup of the grated
cheddar cheese.  Turn into the buttered dish.  Let rise 30 to 40

Crusty Corn Bread

breads

1 cup flour
1 cup corn meal
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1  egg, lightly beaten
1 cup milk
1/4 cup cooking oil

Combine the dry ingredients. Combine the egg with the milk and oil.
Stir into the mixture, mixing until *just* moistened. Pour the
mixture into a preheated, lightly oiled, iron skillet until a little
more than half full. Preheat the skillet by putting it into the oven
when the oven is turned on for preheating. Gives a very crusty
cornbread with the top not cooked as dark as the sides and bottom.
Bake at 425 degrees F. for maybe as much as 20 minutes.  Cool
slightly and cut into squares, then serve warm. This is a trial and
error deal to suit your own taste for sweetness, adjust sugar as you
want, and crustiness.  Don't want crust all over? Then don't use
prehotted cast iron skillet, use 8 inch or 9 inch greased pie pan
instead. Less crust?  Experiment with preheating skillet on top of
stove to varying degrees, choose the one you like.

Crusty Corn Flat Bread

breads

1 cup brown rice flour + additional for d; usting loaves
1 1/2 teaspoon granulated yeast
2  tesapoons sugar
1 1/2 cup warm water (110f)
1 cup corn flour
1/2 cup cornstarch
2 teaspoon xantham gum powder
1  to 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1 tablespoon corn oil

Here's a couple of off beat bread recipes I thought might interest
you. This and the following recipe are wheat free breads.

Combine 1/2 cup of the rice flour, the yeast, sugar and 1/2 cup of
the warm water in a 2-cup glass measure; stir to combine, then let
rest in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 10 minutes.

Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and draw two 8-inch
circles on it.

Combine remaining 1/2 cup rice flour, corn flour, cornstarch, xanthan
gum powder and salt in a large bowl; mix to blend.

Beat eggs lightly; set aside 1 tablespoon for brushing tops of
loaves. Add remaining 1 cup warm water and the corn oil to beaten
eggs. Using a wooden spoon, stir egg and yeast mixtures into flour
and beat until smooth. Using a rubber spatula, spread soft dough into
circles on marked parchment paper, heaping it up slightly in the
center.

Cover loaves lightly with greased plastic wrap and let rise until
doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 425F.

Beat a few drops of water into the reserved beaten egg and brush over
loaves.  Dust lightly with rice flour. Using a razor blade, slash
tops of loaves into a large diamond grid pattern. (Use an up-and-down
cutting motion rather than dragging the blade through the soft dough.)

Bake for 20 minutes, until well browned.

Makes two 8-inch diameter, 11-ounce loaves.

Crusty Country Bread

breads

1  envelope dry yeast
1/3 cup warm water (105-115 f)
4 cup hard wheat white flour
2 teaspoon sugar (optional)
2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cup warm water (120-130 f)

Makes 2 baguettes or 1 long or round loaf

Lightly grease large bowl; set aside.

Stir yeast into 1/3 cup water and let stand until mixture bubbles,
about 5 to 7 minutes.  Combine with flour in mixing bowl. Begin
beating, adding sugar, salt and remaining water, and continue beating
until well mixed.

Turn dough out onto lightly floured board and knead until smooth and
elastic, about 5 minutes.  Place in greased bowl, turning to coat
entire surface.  Cover with plastic wrap and hot, damp towel and let
stand in warm place until almost tripled in volume.  When dough has
risen, transfer to board, punch down and knead about 2 minutes to
eliminate any air bubbles. Return to bowl, cover and let rise again
until at least doubled.

Preheat oven to 425 F.  Grease baking sheet.  On lightly floured
board, punch dough down, roll into oval, then form into desired
shape. Make several slashes diagonally across top with knife or
scissors. Place on baking sheet and let rise until loaf is doubled.
Bake 30 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 F and bake 5 to 10 minutes more
for baguettes, or 15 minutes for single loaf, until golden brown and
bread gives hollow sound when tapped on bottom. Cool on rack.

Crusty Whole-Wheat Baguettes

breads

1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon cold water
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon honey
1 cup whole-wheat flour
1/2 cup bread flour
1  oil and cornmeal for pan

These baguettes are crusty, deep brown and dusted with flour. The
dough can also be shaped into a round and backed on a pizza pan,
preferably black steel. Slash the loaves with a sharp knife or with
the metal blade of a food processor (hold it carefully by the center
hub); deep slashes make a great-looking baguette.

Basic Sponge

In processor fitted with metal blade, Mix Basic Sponge with water,
salt, and honey until smooth. Combine flours. (If processor is
standard- size remove half of sponge mixture and add flours in two
batches.) Add combines flours, 1/4 cup at a time, pulsing several
times to incorporate each addition. Then process dough until supple,
elastic and sticking slightly to work bowl, about 1 minute, adding
more water or flour by teaspoon, if dough is either too dry or too
wet. Dough should be very sticky.

Transfer dough to large plastic bag, squeeze out all air and seal
tightly at top of bag to allow enough room for dough to expand. Set
bag in bowl and let dough rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1
hour.

Oil double baguette bread pan. Sprinkle bottom lightly with cornmeal.
Punch dough down, place on generously floured surface and divide in
half. Pat each piece into rectangle. Start on long side to roll up
dough. Pinch seams to seal. Gently stretch to fit pan, if necessary.
Place dough seam side down, in pan. Sprinkle flour lightly over top.
Cover loosely with plastic. (Can be refrigerated at this point for
several hours. Remove from refrigerator about 1 1/2 hours before
baking.) Let dough rise in warm spot until doubled, about 50 minutes
or longer if previously refrigerated. Slash surface.

About 15 minutes before baking, put rack on bottom of oven at set 1 t
475 degrees F. Place bread in oven, then immediately turn down heat
to 425 degrees F. bake baguettes until deeply browned and sounding
hollow when rapped on bottom. About 15 to 18 minutes. Immediately
remove from pan. Place on wire rack.Makes

Currant Scones

breads, fruits

2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
6 oz butter; very soft
3 tablespoon sugar
1/2 cup currants
2  eggs; lightly beaten
1/3 cup milk; or sour cream

Sift together  flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl. Break
butter into 1 oz pieces and scatter into flour. For the lightest
scones, don't pinch the butter and flour together as when making
biscuits. Scoop up a handful of flour and butter and very, very
lightly run your thumb across your fingers, allowing the flour to
sift through. At first, it will seem as if nothing is happening, but
within 2 minutes the mixture will resemble fine crumbs.

Add sugar, currants and eggs. Lightly fold into the flour mixture
with your hands. Start with about 1/4 cup milk and add a bit at a
time, folding and mixing to make a soft dough. Turn the dough out
onto a lightly floured board. Do not knead; just pat it out into a
rectangle about 1" thick. cut it into 2" diamonds or squares. Put the
scones on a lightly greased baking sheet. Bake at 425øF for 10
minutes, or until lightly browned and puffed.

Czech Dumplings

breads

1 pkg yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 cup milk; scalded and cooled
1 cup milk; warm
1  egg
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 1/2 cup flour
3  slices white bread; cubed

There are a number of different kinds of dumplings in the Czech
cuisine, but if you are serving a pork roast with sauerkraut, I
recommend bread dumplings. Make sure you use the drippings from the
roast to make gravy for these! Mix the first three ingredients, let
stand for 10 minutes. Mix the warm milk, egg, salt, yeast mixture and
flour. Add the bread cubes. Knead the resulting dough just as you
would when making bread. Let the dough rest in a warm place to rise.
It should double in about 2 hours. Knead again; divide into 3 long
rolls, each about 1 1/2 " thick. Let rise another 1/2 hour. Drop the
rolls of dough, one at a time, into a large kettle of boiling water.
Boil gently for about 15 minutes. Remove with slotted spoons and
place on a buttered platter. Keep warm. When ready to serve, slice
the rolls into individual slices by using a length of thread. Loop it
around one dumpling and pull tight to slice off a piece about 2"
thick. (This is the fun part! You can get pretty good at this
garrotting if you practice!!) You should end up with about 2 dozen
slices. My cookbook says, "These freeze well - steam before serving."
(I've never tried that!!) If you would prefer potato dumplings to
these, just say so. The only problem with them is they sometimes get
a bit "slimy" or mushy. I like them that way, but they don't look as
presentable as the bread dumplings.

Daddy's Sourdough Apricot Walnut Bread

breads, sourdough

1 cup starter
1 1/2 cup water
1/2 cup oil
1/2 cup sugar
12  apricots (dried), diced
1/4 cup walnuts, coarsely chopped
2 cup whole wheat flour
4 cup bread flour, bromated
1 teaspoon salt

Feed starter 1/2 C sugar, 1 C water and 1 T instant potato flakes
once a week, stirring well. Let mixture sit in uncovered container
all day to feed and grow. After 8 - 10 hours, remove 1 cup of starter
to bake bread; return remainder of starter to refrigerator in loosely
covered container.

Combine starter, water, oil, sugar and apricots and mix well. Add
walnuts and the whole wheat flour; blend together with a whisk. Add 2
cups of the bread flour and mix again.

Add the last 2 cups of the bread flour, combined with the salt, and
mix again.

The dough will be sticky and a little stiff.  Put the dough in a
greased (or sprayed with Pam) bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Let
rise until doubled in bulk.

Punch down and divide into three equal pieces.  Put each piece into a
greased loaf pan and let rise until they reach the tops of the pans.
Bake at 350 degrees F. for 30 minutes or until browned and pulling
away from the sides of the pans.

Cathe's notes:

*  Was originally Dot Howell's recipe.  You can substitute white corn
syrup for part or all of the oil; the bread might cook more quickly
and brown too soon if not watched carefully.  Can also substitute
1/4 c  oatmeal for 1/4 C flour.

*  Daddy speeds up the process; he feeds the starter and then puts it
into a hot water bath for about an hour. While the starter sits in
its bath, he mixes his ingredients for the bread. He uses 1 cup of
the starter and lets the remainder sit outside for several hours. He
makes his dough and puts it in a hot water bath to rise. When he
punches it down, he puts the pans over a hot water bath to rise. He
accomplishes the entire process in one day instead of two days.

Dak's Sourdough Starter

breads

1 cup nonfat or lowfat milk
3 tablespoon unflavored yogurt (we used
1  nonfat)
1 cup all-purpose flour

In a 1-quart pan over medium heat, heat milk to 90-100 degrees.
Remove from heat and stir in yogurt. Place in a warm 3 to 6 cup
glass, ceramic, plastic or stainless steel container with a tight
lid. Cover and let stand in a warm place until mixture is the
consistency of yogurt and a curd has formed. (You can test the
mixture by tilting the container. If the mixture doesn't flow freely
when the container is tilted, it's ready.) The curding process takes
about 18 to 24 hours. You'll need to check it periodically. If some
clear liquid rises to the top of the milk, stir it back in. NOTE: If
the liquid turns pink, discard the batch and start again. Once the
curd has formed, add the flour and stir until smooth. Cover again and
let stand in a warm place until the mixture is full of bubbles and
has a good sour smell. This should take about 2 to 5 days. Again, if
some clear liquid rises to the top stir it back in. If the liquid
turns pink, discard the batch and start again. When the mixture is
ready, you can keep it covered and store it in the refrigerator until
you need it. The recipe makes about
1 1/3    cup starter.

Damper

breads, australian

2 1/2 cup flour, self-raising
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon butter
1 teaspoon sugar
1 cup milk
      -----or-----
1/2 can powdered milk
1 can water

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Mix together the dry ingredients and the
butter.   Add the liquid and mix well.  Knead for about 5 minutes (if you
don't know about kneading, look in a good cookery book with plenty of
pictures, it's difficult to describe in words).

Shape into a flattened ball and place on a greased and floured baking sheet
or in a greased and floured round cake tin (I recommend the latter, about 7
or 8 inch diameter, as it gives a better shape). Bake for 30 minutes. Use a
Dutch oven if you are cooking in an open fire, and use your experience as
to cooking time.

Serve in moderately thick slices while still fairly hot.   I'm told that
golden syrup (a treacle-like substance made as a by-product of cane sugar
refining)  is the traditional thing to spread on it, and that goes well.
Jam is good, too.

NOTES:

*  Bread as made by drovers in the outback -- I don't know how many of you
realize it, but there is a wealth of TV programmes about cooking from
around the world. We are lucky in that Australia's SBS network (Special
Broadcasting Service "multi-cultural television") has a regular slot for
food and wine at a convenient time on Saturday evenings. Over the last
couple of years we have seen series on French, Indian, Chinese, English,
Vegetarian, Australian and Sri Lankan cookery, among others. If you're
missing out, why not call your local station?

This recipe comes from a series called "Australian Tableland".
Traditionally, damper should be cooked in the coals of a camp fire, but the
temperature in an oven is much more consistent! This recipe has the
advantages of being simple and, with ordinary care, reliable.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  measure carefully.

Delicate Whole-Wheat Pasta

breads

1 cup flour, whole-wheat pastry
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup flour, unbleached
2  eggs
2 teaspoon olive oil
2 tablespoon water; (more as needed)

Sift flours and salt together into a large mixing bowl or food
processor. Add the eggs and oil, and work together until you have a
moderately sticky lump (if working by hand) or a grainy mixture (if
working with a food processor). Add 2 T. water, and work the dough
until you have a fairly firm lump. Add a little more water or flour
as needed to get a good-feeling texture. If working by hand, don't
try to reincorporate the flakes that fall off the main lump. Knead
the dough gently for 5 minutes, wrap in a damp dish towel, and let it
rest 30 minutes to an hour. Divide the dough into 8 parts and roll
out very thin with a rolling pin or pasta roller. It will thicken and
shrink a bit after the rolling, so roll a little thinner than you
want it to end up. Makes 24 lasagne noodles, or enough
spaghetti/fettucine for 8.

Detmold Sourdough Bread

breads, yeast, sour, yeastfree

1 x no ingredients

PREPARATION OF STARTER, FIRST EVENING

It is best to make a new starter with every batch of bread. To 1/2 tsp
DETMOLD powder, add 1 cup warm (85F) water and approximately 1 cup of
flour, such that the mixture has the consistency of thick soup. Cover
and keep in a warm place (e.g. the oven with light on) for 24 hours.
There should tehn be bubbles in the mixture and a dark coloured
liquid should have separated.


PREPARATION OF STARTER, SECOND EVENING  %%%%%


Add the starter mixture to 8 cups of warm water and optionally cooked
sweet rice (see below).  Add sufficient flour to give the consistency
of thick soup.  cover and let sit overnight in a warm place. The
sponge can be made from water and flour only, but a much sweeter
bread results from using a significant amount of cooked sweet rice.
Twoo cups of dry sweet rice can be cooked in 8 cups of water and
allowed to cool for the sweet rice ingredient mentioned above.

PREPARATION OF DOUGH, NEXT MORNING

The sponge has now risen, and 1 cup of this could be saved for
subsequent starter if kept refrigerated and used within a few days.
However, even in the refrigerator, the mixture will soon acquire wild
yeasts and no longer be completely yeast-free.  Add to the risen
starter more flour until it becomes a kneadable dough. This will
require 12-18 cups of whole wheat flour.  Knead the dough as little
as possible. Form the dough into loaves (about 5) and place into well
oiled pans. Ordinary bread pans do work, but the bread tends to be
thick crusted and to dry quickly. Round cans such as coffee cans, or
48 oz juice cans give a bread that rises better and dries less
quickly.  Cover the pans with aluminum foil and let them sit in a
warm place for at least 4 hours.

BAKING BREAD, AFTERNOON

Place the loaves in a cold oven and turn the oven to 350F. Bake for
about 1-1/2 hours TOTAL oven time. Freeze the bread if it is not
going to be used within the next few days. It is best to use freezer
bags with the air drawn out, and double sealed.

Devonshire Splits

breads

1/2 lb stong white bread flour
1 teaspoon easy-blend yeast
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1 oz butter; melted
1/4 pint milk; warmed
      ----TO FINISH----
1  icing sugar
1  clotted cream
1  good jam

Using a food-processor, a food mixer with a dough hook, or your
hands, mix the dry ingredients, add the warm milk and melted butter
and mix and knead to a smooth elastic dough. Cover with lightly oiled
polythene and leave to rise until doubled in size - about 1 hour in a
warm place.

Knock back and knead again briefly.  Divide the dough into eight
and shape into small round buns. Space them well apart on a greased
baking tray.  Cover and set aside to prove (rise) until light and
puffy - about 20 minutes.

Bake at 425 F (220 C) gas mark 7 for 15-20 minutes until golden
brown. Cool, then cut each bun down the middle, from top to bottom
but not all the way through. Split open and fill with cream and jam.
Be generous, allowing plenty of jam and no less than 1 oz clotted
cream per bun. Then dust with icing sugar. Makes 8 buns.

Donna German's Sourdough Starter

breads, german

2 cup lukewarm water or milk
2 cup bread or unbleached all purpose flo; ur
2 1/2 teaspoon yeast

Mix together in a GLASS or PLASTIC BOWL the above ingredients. Do not
use metal utensils.  Cover the bowl with a tight fitting lid and
allow to sit in a warm, draft-free location for 4 to 7 days, gently
stirring once a day.

You may use your starter after 4 days.

To use your starter, simply remove the amount called for in the
recipe and add to the other ingredients. Replace the amount removed
with equal amounts of water/milk and bread/unbleached all purpose
flour. I always used bread flour.

After feeding your starter, leave on counter for 24 hours. At the end
of that period you may refrigerate your starter. You must refeed at
least once every 7 days, so I use my starter once a week. If you do
not plan to use it, then take one cup out and throw away and feed.

If you will be away on vacation you may freeze your starter, thaw it
in the refrigerator upon your return. As soon as it is thawed, remove
at least one cup and feed as above.

I alternate feedings, one week with milk, the next with water.

Double Apple Bread

breads, quick&easy, apples

1 cup walnuts
1/2 cup butter
1 cup plus 2 t light brown sugar
2  eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cup applesauce, unsweetened
1 2/3 cup flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour  preferably stone; ground
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1 large tart apple*, pared, cored,  quarter; ed and chopped
1/2 cup raisins, plumped if dry**

* Granny Smith or Greening ** to plump raisins: place them in a small
saucepan with water to cover. Bring to a simmer over moderate heat.
Drain thoroughly.

Preparation: Preheat oven to 350F.  In the preheating oven, toast the
walnuts in a single layer in a roasting pan or jelly roll pan.
Coarsely chop and set aside to cool. Butter a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan and
set aside.

In a large bowl using an electric mixer at high speed, cream butter
until light. Gradually add the sugar and continue beating until
mixture is very light and fluffy. Change the mixer speed to medium.
Add the eggs, one at a time, beating with each addition, then beat in
the vanilla and the applesauce.  (The mixture will look hopelessly
curdled. Do not worry!)

Change the mixer speed ot low.  Sift in the flours, baking soda, salt,
cinnamon, and nutmeg and beat just until combined. Stir in chopped
apple, raisins and walnuts.

Spread the batter in the prepared pan with a spatula, smoothing the
top.

Bake until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, about 90
minutes, loosly covering the top of the loaf with aluminum foil after
50 minutes or so if the loaf seems to darkening too quickly. Let the
loaf stan in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes before unmolding.
Cool completely before wrapping or serving.

Dough For Regular Crust Pizza

breads

4 cup all-purpose flour
1  cake yeast
1 1/3 cup warm water
2 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon parmesan, grated
1  cornmeal

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place the pizza baking stone(s) or
tile(s) in the oven to be heated. Dissolve the yeast in the warm (85
degrees F) water. Let stand without stirring until the mixture foams
(8-10 minutes). Combine the flour and salt in a bowl. Add the olive
oil and yeast mixture. Stir well. Add the grated Parmesan. Stir well.

Dough For Thick Crust Or Pan Pizza

breads

2 teaspoon yeast
1 1/2 cup warm water
4 cup flour
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup olive oil
1 teaspoon parmesan, grated fine
1  cornmeal

NOTE: The differences between a Pan Pizza and a Thick Crust Pizza are
the thickness of the crust and the fact that a Pan Pizza is baked in
a Pizza Pan with deep (2-2 1/2") sides and a Thick Crust Pizza is NOT
baked in a pan but on stone or a tile in the oven (and then put in a
pan to serve).

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees (if planning a Thick Crust Pizza,
place the sto tile in the oven to heat). Dissolve the yeast in the
warm (105 degrees-115 degrees) water. Wait until the mixture foams
(about 5 minutes). Combine the flour and yeast in a bowl. Add the
yeast mixture. Add the olive oil. Add the parmesan. Mix thoroughly.
Turn the dough out onto a well floured board. Knead until smooth
(about 10 minutes). Place the dough in a greased bowl and let rise
until doubled (about 1 hour). Punch the dough down and roll out on a
well floured board. Roll to 3/4" thickness for Thick Crust Pizza or
2" thickness for a Pan Pizza. Brush the dough generously with olive
oil. THICK CRUST: Lightly oil a (14") pizza pan. Sprinkle some
cornmeal onto the pan. Form the dough into a pie using the pan. Place
the sauce(s) and topping(s) on the dough, leaving the outer 1/2"
bare. Remove the pie from the pizza pan. Use a paddle to place the
dough on the stone. PAN PIZZA: Lightly oil the pizza pan. Sprinkle
some cornmeal in the bottom of the pan. Press the dough into place in
the pan, pressing it down into the bottom and up the sides of the
pan. Add the sauce(s), seasoning(s) and topping(s), leaving the
outermost 1/2" bare Place in the preheated oven. BOTH: Bake until the
cheese is bubbly and the crust is golden. Use a paddle to remove the
Thick Crust Pizza from the oven and place it on a serving pan. Use
hot pads to remove the Pan Pizza from the oven. Serve.

Dow Sah Bow/ Cha Siu Bow

breads, chinese

1  cake of fresh compressed yeast
1 3/4 cup of warm water
3/4 cup of sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
6 1/2 cup unsifted all purpose flour

First you need to make the dough. This dough is good for steamed or
baked 'bows' (buns). It will yield 2 dozen buns:

For the dough, you need:

Dissolve 1/2 yeast cake with sugar in warm water. Immediately add
baking powder and then the flour. The dough will be firm and fairly
dry. Knead on board for 20 minutes until dough is elastic and smooth.
Place in a mixing bowl, cover with a damp cloth and leave in a dry
warm draft-free place until dough doubles in bulk. (about 2 1/2 - 3
hours). Punch down the dough and knead 5 minutes more and it's ready
to be stuffed.

If you want Cha Siu Bow, you'll need:

4 cups of finely diced barbecued pork 1/2 cup dehydrated onion flakes

For the sauce (in Cha Siu Bow) use: 2 tsp Hoisin Sauce 2 tsp Sherry 4
tsp Oyster Sauce 2 tsp Ketchup 1 tsp Sugar 1 1/2 tb Cornstarch 1 1/2
cup Chicken Stock

Soak the onion flakes in a cup with enough water to cover flakes. Mix
sauce ingredients in a small sauce pan. Cook over medium high heat
until sauce thickens. Stir in diced pork and onion flakes. Chill for
3 - 4 hours.

If you want Dow Sah Bows, use a can of sweet red bean paste.

Divide the filling (pork mixture or sweet bean paste) into 24
portions. Divide dough into 24 balls. Slightly flatten each ball then
roll out into 4 inch discs, leaving the center twice as thick as the
side. Place 1 portion of the filling in the centre. Gather up the
sides around the filling, twist dough to seal. Place on a 2 inch
square piece of wax paper, twist side down.  Allow buns to rise in
draft-free place for another hour.

You can cook them by steaming them 15 minutes. This will give you a
white bun.

You can also bake these. Preheat oven to 350. Brush with a mixture of
1 beaten egg white, 1 tsp and 1/4 tsp sugar. Bake 20 - 25 minutes
until golden brown. Brush with melted butter. From "Dim Sum" by Rhoda

1/2 cup dried tart cherries; cut up
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup chilled butter; cut up

Drop Scones

beverages, breads

1 cup all-pupose flour
1 pinch baking soda
1 pinch salt
3 tablespoon sugar
2/3 cup buttermilk
1  egg, lightly beaten
2 teaspoon butter, melted, cooled
1  butter

Scotland's version of the scone, sometimes known as "Scot's Pancake".
Looks more like a crumpet, though the texture resembles a pancake.

Preheat a griddle or heavy skillet over high heat; grease lightly.
Sift flour, baking soda and salt into a large bowl. Stir in sugar. Add
buttermilk, egg, and melted butter and mix well with a wooden spoon.
Drop tablespoonfuls of batter onto griddle or skillet, spacing scones
well apart.  Cook a few minutes or until tops are bubbling and
undersides are golden brown; flip over with a wide spatula and cook
until brown on other side.  As scones are cooked, wrap them in a
cloth towl or napkin to keep them moist and warm while you cook
remaining scones. Serve warm with butter.  Makes 12 to 15 scones.

VARIATIONS:  Fruit Drop Scones - Add 1/2 cup raisins (plumped) to dry
ingredients.

Drop Scones (Bakestone Recipes)

breads, cakes, breakfast

4 oz self-raising flour
2 tablespoon granulated sugar
1  egg, beaten
5 fl oz milk*

*Approximate.  -- Sift the flour into a mizing bowl and mix in the
sugar. Make a well in the center of the flour and drop in the egg.
Stir in the milk gradually and mix to a creamy batter. The thicker
the batter, the thicker the pancake will be.  Heat the bakestone and
grease lightly. Using a large spoon, drop the batter off it in round
"puddles" onto the bakestone, leaving room for spreading. Cook over a
moderate heat until the top surface is covered with bubbles, and when
the underside is golden, turn and cook the other side. When golden,
lift off the bakestone and wrap in a cloth.  Serve as soon as
possible with butter, honey and preserves. If any are left until the
next day, they can be crisped under the grill before serving. For a
change, 1 oz of butter can be rubbed into the flour and sugar:  or
lemon essence (six drops) can be added to the batter.

Early-Bird Buttermilk Pancakes

breads, breakfast

1 1/2 cup flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup buttermilk
2/3 cup milk
1  egg; beaten
2 tablespoon cooking oil
1  oil for pan
1/2 cup milk; as needed for thinning

SIFT TOGETHER THE FLOUR, sugar, salt and baking powder. Beat together
the buttermilk, milk, beaten egg and oil. Pour the liquid into the dry
ingredients and stir until well mixed. A few small lumps in the
mixture will cook out. The first pancake is a test pancake. The
batter should be thin for pancakes, so thin the batter if necessary
with milk (not buttermilk). The pan should be lightly oiled and hot
enough to make a sprinkling of water dance, not just sit and sizzle.
Ladle about 1/8 cup of the batter into the hot pan. When the top of
the pancake is full of bubbles and the bottom is golden, turn the
pancake. Cook on the second side until done.

Easy But Good Bread

breads

1 x no ingredients

Mix 2C flour with 1 t salt  (I use 1/2 whole wheat flour and adjust
water)

Scald 1/2 C milk.  Add in 1 1/2 C boiling water and let cool to
lukewarm.

Dissolve 1 package yeast in 1/4 C lukewarm water.

Add the dissolved yeast to the milk/water and add to the dry
ingredients, along with 1 T sugar and 1 1/2 T oil.

Mix well but don't knead.

Cover and let rise until almost doubled in bulk.

Punch down.  Form into two sort of flat shapes.  Roll each (sort of
jellyroll like) into two loaves. They'll be a little longer and
thinner than average bread. Cover and let rise again until almost
doubled in bulk, or until a finger indentation doesn't disappear
after a few minutes.

Place on oiled cookie sheet.  Place a pie pan with 1/2 " of boiling
water on the bottom of the oven.

Bake 15 minutes at 400 and 30 minutes at 350.

You know it's done when it sounds hollow when tapped on crust.

Easy Corn Bread

breads

1 1/4 cup all purpose flour
3/4 cup corn meal
1/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 each egg, beaten

Heat oven to 400 degrees.  Grease 8 or 9 inch baking pan. Combine dry
ingredients.  Stir in milk, oil and egg, mixing just until dry
ingredients are moistened. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake 20 -
25 minutes or until lightly brown and wooden tooth pick inserted near
center comes out clean. Serve warm.  Serves 9. Microwave directions:
Mix ingredients same as above and pour batter into UNGREASED pan.
Microwave on HIGH 5 - 6 minutes, rotating 1/4 turn after 2 minutes.
Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
Hope this is simple enough.....  As the recipe says...only mix
ingredients until moistened.  If you beat it too much it would come
out solid rather than light and airy. I cover the baking pan with
Saran Wrap leaving part of one corner pulled back for steam to get
out when I put it in the microwave...seems to help it bake more
evenly. The center will seem a little soggy when you take it out but
remember it continues to cook during that 5 minutes before you serve
it. Time also makes a difference depending on the wattage of your
micro. I think I leave mine in for about 7 minutes.

breads, main dish, seafood

3 small loaves french bread
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoon melted butter
3  doz fresh oysters
2 tablespoon melted butter
1  milk

First, almost split the loaves lengthwise, leaving a hinge. Scoop out
the soft middle and save the crumbs. Then add a 1/2 tsp of garlic
powder (not salt) to 2 Tbls melted butter, and brush the cavities.

Next, drain the oysters and save the liquid.  Saute' them in the rest
of the butter till the edges curl - about 5 minutes. Put the oysters
into the loaves, mix the crumbs you saved with the oyster liquid you
saved, and add them, too.  Shut up the loaves now. STOP HERE.

Then wrap them in cheesecloth dipped in milk, twisting the ends and
tucking them under the loaf.  Bake them on a baking sheet for half an
hour at 350^. Cut them in half before you serve them.

6    servings

(Note from the book: Eddy was a San Franciscan who owned a bar and
made small oyster loaves for his married male customers to take home
to their wives. These were pacifiers. But Eddy is dead now, and
Mother must pacify herself.  This is good for a special lunch. I also
know a family who has it traditionally as Christmas Eve supper.)

Edinburgh Tearoom Scones/Lemon Curd

breads, biscuits

1  scones
2 cup flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup buttermilk
1 large egg
1/2 cup raisins or currents
1  milk
1  sugar
1  lemon curd
4 large eggs
1 pinch salt
1 3/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup butter
2 tablespoon lemon peel
1/2 cup fresh lemon juice

Recipe by: Edinburgh Tearoom, Edinburgh SCONES
Heat oven to 425~.  Sift dry ingredients together. Cut in butter.
Add raisins or currents.  Mix buttermilk and egg together. Add all at
once to flour. Mix with fork just until mixture clings together. Form
into ball, turn out on floured surface and knead gently until smooth,
not more than 5 turns of the dough. Pat out til 1/2 inch thick and
cut with a 2" cutter. Place on baking sheet 1 inch apart. Brush tops
lightly with milk and sprinkle with sugar. Bake 10 minutes until
golden brown. Serve with Lemon Curd. LEMON CURD
Beat eggs in top of double boiler. Stir in remaining ingredients.
Cook over simmering water 30 minutes, stirring frequently until thick
and smooth. (I do not use a double boiler, but use a low heat and
watch closely to prevent burning). When it has thickened, remove from
heat. It will thicken more when cooled. Cool, cover and refrigerate.
Keeps 2 to 3 weeks in refrigerator. This has become a holiday
breakfast tradition for our family and I give small jars of the Lemon
Curd as gifts along with the Scone recipe for friends who bake.

Egg Braid

breads

1/4  to 1/2 cup warm water
1 pkg active dry yeast
1 tablespoon sugar
2 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup instant nonfat dry milk
1/4 cup cold butter or margarine, cut into; 4 pieces
1 teaspoon salt
2  eggs, beaten
1  egg
1  sesame or poppy seeds, optional

Makes 1 loaf

Combine 1/4 cup water, yeast and sugar.  Stir to dissolve yeast and
let stand until bubbly, about 5 minutes.

Fit processor with steel blade.  Measure flour, dry milk, butter and
salt into work bowl.  Process until mixed, about 15 seconds.

Add yeast mixture to flour mixture.  Process until blended, about 10
seconds.

Turn on processor and slowly drizzle the 2 beaten eggs through feed
tube and just enough remaining water so dough forms a ball that
cleans the sides of the bowl. Process until ball turns around bowl
about 25 times. Turn off processor and let dough stand 1 to 2 minutes.

Turn on processor and gradually drizzle in enough remaining water to
make dough soft, smooth and satiny but not sticky. Process until
dough turns around bowl about 15 times.

Turn dough onto lightly floured surface.  Shape into ball and place in
lightly greased bowl, turning to grease all sides. Cover with plastic
wrap and let stand in warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.

Punch down dough.  Divide into 3 equal parts.  Shape each part into a
strand about 18 inches long.  Braid the strands loosely together.
Tuck ends under and pinch to seal. Fit braid into greased 8 1/2 x 4
1/2 x 2 1/2 inch loaf pan.  Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let
stand in warm place until almost doubled, about 1 hour.

Heat oven to 375 F.  Beat remaining egg with fork. Brush egg over
braid. Sprinkle sesame or poppy seeds over braid, if desired. Bake
until evenly browned, 25 ~ 30 minutes.

Remove immediately from pan.  Cool on wire rack.

REFRIGERATOR EGG BRAID:  Prepare dough through first rising and shape
into braid as directed for Egg Braid. Place in greased loaf pan,
brush with vegetable oil and cover tightly with plastic wrap.
Refrigerate 4 to 24 hours.  Uncover and let stand at room temperature
30 minutes. Bake as directed for Egg Braid.

RAISIN BREAD:  Prepare dough as directed for Egg Braid. Turn dough
onto lightly floured surface and knead 1/2 cup dark raisins into the
dough. Continue as directed for Egg Braid, eliminating sesame or
poppy seeds.

Election Day Loaf

breads

2 pkg dry yeast
1 1/2 cup warm water
2 teaspoon sugar
6 cup unbleached flour, divided
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
3/4 cup butter, at room temperature
1 cup sugar
2  eggs, at room temperature
1 1/2 cup raisins
3/4 cup chopped walnuts or pecans
1/2 cup chopped citron
1 tablespoon flour
1  icing:
1 cup confectioner's sugar
1 1/2 tablespoon orange juice
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 pinch of salt

Mew England legend decrees that votes were bought in exchange for this
loaf. You may not win an election, but you will get an overwhelming
vote of confidence if you serve this bread to the poll watchers
gathered in your home on election night.

In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water. Add 2 tsp sugar
and 1 1/2 cups flour.  beat well, about 150 strokes. Cover the bowl
tightly and set in a warm, draft-free place for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, sift the remaining flour with the salt, cinnamon, cloves,
and nutmeg on a piece of wax paper.  In a small bowl, cream the
butter and sugar. When the yeast batter has only 5 more minutes to
rise, add the eggs to the creamed butter.

Beat well.  Stir down the yeast batter.  Spoon in the butter mixture
and blend well.  Add the sifted dry ingredients a spoonful at a time,
beating after each one until the mixture is smooth. Dredge the
raisins, nuts and citron in the tbsp of flour and stir into the
batter. Pour the batter into a greased 10 inch tube pan. Make it
level by using a spoon dipped in cold water.  Cover the pan with wax
paper and place in a warm, draft-free spot for about 1-1/2 hours, or
until a wooden tooth-pick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Check halfway through baking time; if the top gets too brown, cover
loosely with foil or brown paper. Remove from oven and let cool for
10 minutes before turning the bread onto a wire rack to cool.

Spread on the icing while the bread is still warm. Makes 1 loaf.

Emeril's Sourdough Starter

breads

1 cup unbleached flour, plus more
1  for feeding
1/2 cup whole grain rye flour
1 cup bottled still water, plus
1  more for feeding

In a large glass bowl stir flours and water together with a spoon.
Cover with a kitchen towel. Set aside to ferment at room temp for 2
to 3 days. It will begin to smell sour, but not in an unpleasant way.
Stir in 2/3 cup flour and 1/2 cup water, cover and continue to
ferment at room temp. Refresh starter in this way every day for 3
days. It will become sharper and more pungent as it sits. When it is
sharp enough for you, begin using it to bake with. After using the
amount of starter you need, the remaining starter should be
refrigerated. Let it come to room temp each time you use it.

English Crumpets (Bakestone Recipes)

breads, breakfast

4 oz all-purpose flour
4 oz bread flour
2 teaspoon salt
1/4 oz fresh yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 pint warm milk and water
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
1/4 pint warm water

Sift the flours and salt into a warm bowl.  Cream the yeast with the
sugar. Add the warmed milk and water, then the oil.  Stir into the
flour to make a batter, and beat vigorously until smooth and elastic.
Cover the bowl, put in a warm place and leave it until the mixture
rises and the surface is full of bubbles (about 1 1/2 hours).  Break
it down by beating with a wooden spoon.  Cover and leave in a warm
place to prove for another 30 minutes.  -- To cook the crumpets, heat
and grease the bakestone lightly. Grease 5 or 6 crumpet rings (3-3
1/2 inches) (or scone cutters) and put them on the bakestone to heat.
Cook as many crumpets as possible at a time, as the batter will not
stay bubbly for long.   -- Put 1/2 inch deep of batter into each
ring.  Cook gently for 7 - 10 minutes, or until the surface sets and
is full of tiny bubbles.  Using an oven glove for protection, lift
off the ring, and if the base of the crumpet is pale gold, flip it
over and cook for another 3 minutes until the other side is just
colored.  If the crumpet batter is set but sticks slightly in the
ring, push it out gently with the back of a wooden spoon.  Wipe,
grease and heat the rings for each batch of crumpets.  If serving
immediately, wrap the crumpets in a cloth and keep warm between
batches.  Butter generously and serve at once.  If reheating, toast
the crumpets under the grill, cooking the smooth surface first and
then the top so that the butter will melt into the holes.

breads, breakfast

      ----SPONGE----
1/4 cup warm water (110øf)
1 pinch sugar
1 pkg active dry yeast
1 1/2 cup warm milk (110øf)
2 tablespoon unsalted butter, cut in
1  small pieces and softened
1 tablespoon honey
2 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
      ----DOUGH----
1 1/4 teaspoon salt
2 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1  cornmeal

Sponge: Butter a 4 quart mixing bowl. In a small bowl, combine warm
water and pinch sugar. Sprinkle yeast over water mixture. Let stand
until yeast dissolves and bubbles. While yeast is dissolving, in
buttered bowl combine warm milk, butter and honey. Stir until butter
is almost melted. Stir in 2 1/2 cups flour and dissolved yeast. Beat
on high speed for 3 minutes. Cover and let rise in warm place until
doubled, about 30 minutes.

Dough: Butter a 4 quart bowl. Stir salt into bread mixture. Stir in
enough of remaining flour with a wooden spoon until dough forms a
ball. Turn dough out onto a well-floured surface. Knead until smooth
and elastic, about 8-10 minutes, adding enough of remaining flour to
keep dough from sticking. Place dough in buttered bowl, turning once
to butter surface.

Cover and let rise in a warm place until double, about 45 minutes.
Punch dough down. Divide dough in half. Sprinkle board generously
with cornmeal. Turn dough out on board. Sprinkle cornmeal over top of
dough. Gently roll half the dough at a time 1/2" thick. Cut with a
floured biscuit cutter into 3" rounds. Repeat with remaining half of
dough. Knead, reroll, and cut dough scraps once, if desired. Arrang
dough rounds on ungreased baking sheets 2" apart.

Cover and let rise in a warm place until double, about 30 minutes.
Heat a lightly oiled, nonstick griddle or skillet over medium-high
heat. Lift some of the dough rounds with a spatula onto griddle. Cook
for 2 minutes on each side. Reduce heat to medium. Cook, turning
every few minutes, 13-18 minutes until done in crnter. Cool on racks.

Ethereal Air Bread Ii

breads

2 tablespoon yeast, dry
1 teaspoon diastatic malt powder
8 cup flour, all purpose
1 tablespoon salt
2 cup milk, skim
1/4 cup oil, vegetable
1/4 cup honey
2 large egg whites, lightly beaten

Mix the yeast, diastatic malt powder, 6 cups flour, and the salt
together. In a saucepan heat the milk, vegetable oil, and honey to
120F. The liquid will just start to feel hot. Pour the liquid into
the dry ingredients, and add the lightly beaten egg whites. Add
another cup of flour and stir until the dough has formed a shaggy
mass. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and knead the
dough, adding more flour as necessary, until the dough has formed a
smooth ball. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning the
dough to coat with oil. Cover the bowl with a damp towel. Place the
dough in a warm spot and let rise until doubled in size. This will
take about l
1/2    hours.
Punch the dough down and turn out onto a lightly floured counter.
Knead the dough briefly to expel air bubbles. Grease two 8 1/2" x 4
1/2" loaf pans. Divide the dough into two pieces and roll each piece
out into a rectangle the same length as the pans. The rectangles
should be about 1/4" thick. Roll up the dough the long way and place
it in the pans. Cover the loaves with a damp towel and let them rise
30-45 minutes, until they are about 1" over the top of the pans.
While the loaves are rising, preheat the oven to 375F. Bake the
loaves for 35-34 minutes, or until well browned and the bottoms sound
hollow when thumped. Cool the loaves on a rack. Yield: Two loaves,
each yielding sixteen 1/2 inch slices.

Fancy Coconut Rotti

breads, ceylon

3 cup flour
1 cup desiccated coconut
6  curry leaves *
2 tablespoon crushed dried shrimp
1/2  onion, chopped
10  green chilies, chopped
1 cup warm water (approx., just enough to; moisten the dough)
1  vegetable oil
      ----FILLING----
1/2 cup green onions or leeks, finely chopp; ed
1 teaspoon crushed, dried red chilies
1/2 cup cabbage, finely chopped
1/2 cup kale, finely chopped
1  a few curry leaves* (optional)
1  salt
1  black pepper
1  vegetable oil for frying

Combine the ingredients, mix well, and add enough warm water to make
a soft dough.  Knead it until it forms a ball and does not stick to
the sides of the bowl. Shape it into balls about 2 inches in
diameter. Then flatten each ball on a greased plate or cutting
surface, spreading it until it is as thin or thick as desired. Fill
with the following:

Filling: In a bowl, combine the green onions or leeks, red chilies,
cabbage, kale, and curry leaves.  Add salt and pepper to taste. Heat
the oil in a skillet, and saute the vegetables and spices until
golden. Place about 2 tablespoons of the filling on each rotti, fold
the rotti in half, and pinch the edges together to form a packet
enclosing the vegetables. Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet, and
fry each rotti until the filling is warmed through.

*Curry leaves - edible gray-green leaves that resemble bay leaf, used
in flavoring sambols and fish, vegetable, or meat curries. The Sri
Lankans use curry leaves fresh, but they can be used dried if fresh
leaves are not available.  The Sinhalese term for the plant is
'karapincha', and if you can find them fresh, they add great depth
and flavor to a dish. They are not removed before serving, and they
are edible. There is no substitute for curry leaves.

Farinata (Chick Pea Bake)

breads, italian, argentinian

6 1/4 cup water
4 cup garbanzo (chick pea) flour
1  salt; to taste
8 tablespoon olive oil; or corn oil
1 large onion, sliced (optional)
1  freshly ground black pepper

This Italian dish is also popular in Argentina.  They call it faina'
and it is sometimes prepared with onion slices as a topping. A plain
faina' slice is often used to top a pizza slice, sandwich-style.

Pour the water into a large heavy pan, then gradually stir in the
flour. Add salt to taste.  Cook over gentle heat for 1 hour, stirring
frequently and skimming the surface with a slotted spoon
occasionally; the mixture should be smooth and quite thick.

Pour the mixture into an oiled roasting pan (preferably a pizza pan)
and level the surface. Sprinkle the oil over the surface, and arrange
the onion rings on top, if used.

Bake in a moderately hot oven (400 F / 200 C) for 30 minutes until
golden brown.  Sprinkle liberally with pepper and serve immediately.

Fig Square

breads, vegetarian

1 pkg (or 1 tablespoon) active dried yeas; t
1/4 cup warm water (110 to 115 degrees)
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 cup milk, at room temperature
1  egg
1 teaspoon orange rind, grated
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 1/2 cup unbleached white flour
1 1/2 cup dried figs, snipped
1 cup water
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1  confectioners' sugar (optional)

Soften the yeast in the warm water.  Combine the sugar, salt, oil,
milk, egg and orange rind in a large bowl. Beat well. Add the yeast
mixture and the 1 cup of whole wheat flour. Beat. Add the remaining
flour. Extra flour may be needed if the dough is sticky.

Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 5
minutes. Transfer to an oiled bowl, cover with a damp towel and let
rise for 1 hour.

Meanwhile, prepare the fig filling by combining the figs, water and
allspice in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer
until the mixture is thick. Mash the figs with a potato masher or
large spoon during cooking. Cool.

Punch down the dough.  Roll into a 1/2-inch thick rectangle 8 inches
wide. Spread with the fig filling. Roll up like a jelly roll. Fit
into a lightly oiled 8-inch-square pan. Seal the edges together. At
each corner cut with a scissors to fit into the shape of the pan.
Make two slashes on top of each side. Let rise until doubled, about
30 minutes. Bake in a 350-degree oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Cool.

May be sprinkled lightly with confectioners' sugar just before
serving.

the remaining flour to make a SOFT (should be slightly sticky and
light in weight). Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and
let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Knead until smooth and elastic (about 8
to 10 minutes). Form into a ball and put into a greased bowl, turning
to grease the top of the ball of dough. Cover and let rise in a warm
draft free place until doubled in bulk. Punch the dough down,
kneading lightly to remove all of the air pockets, and turn the dough
out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut
the dough into rounds using a 3-inch biscuit or cookie cutter. Cover
with waxed paper and let rise on the rolling surface away from drafts
and direct heat, until double in bulk, (30 to 45 minutes). About 20
minutes before frying, heat the fat.  Fry the doughnuts in the heated
fat. Put only as many doughnuts at one time as will float uncrowded
in a single layer deep in the fat. Fry 2 to 3 minutes or until
lightly browned; turn the doughnuts with a fork or tongs, being
careful not to pierce the doughnut, when they rise to the surface. Do
this several times during the cooking. Lift from the fat, draining
for a few seconds over the fat before removing to absorbent paper
toweling. Cool. Cut a slit through the center in the side of each
doughnut. Force about 1/2 ts of jam or jelly into the center and
press lightly to close the slit. (A pastry bag and tube may be used
to force the jelly or jam into the slit.) Shake 2 or 3 bismarks at
one time in a bag containing granulated or powdered sugar. (Your
choice.) Shake lightly to remove the excess sugar.

2 tablespoon olive oil
1  cornstarch, for dusting pastry boar; d

Sift flour and salt into bowl. Gradually add water to make a stiff
dough. Turn onto pastry board.

Place the oil in a bowl and spread a little of it on the palms of your
hands. Knead the dough, gradually adding more oil until you have a
smooth, elastic ball. Roll the ball of dough in the remaining oil to
cover all sides. Place in a bowl, cover with a cloth, and allow to
stand in a warm place for about 2 hours.

Divide the dough into 10 parts and roll to 1/4-inch thickness on a
pastry board dusted with cornstarch. Cover with a cloth and let set
for 10 minutes.

Cover a table or counter top with a smooth cloth and lift rolled
dough onto it. Put your hands, palms down, under the dough and gently
stretch the dough with the backs of your hands, working your way
around the table until the dough is stretched as thin as tissue
paper. For moist filo, using scissors, cut dough immediately into
desired size pieces; if you prefer dry filo, allow it to stand for
about 10 minutes before cutting.

Finnish Sour Rye Bread

breads

3 1/2 cup rye flour
3 cup warm water, flat beer
1  buttermilk or potato water
1/4 cup warm water (100-105o)
3 1/2 cup or 4c all purpose flour
1  egg lightly beaten with
1 tablespoon water
1 pkg dry yeast
2 tablespoon salt

four days ahead of bread making, prepare the starter: combine 1 cup
rye flour with 1 cup liquid, cover loosely and set in a warm place.
Stir once or twice each day, adding more liquid if the mixture
becomes too dry. it should bubble and give off a strong odor.

when ready to prepare the dough, put the starter in a large mixing
bowl, add 2 more cups of whatever liquid was used and stir. Dissolve
the yeast and salt in 1/4 cup warm water and stir in. Then beat in
the remaining rye flour and up to 4 cups of the white flour one cup
at a time to make a somewhat soft biscuit like dough firm enough to
hold it's shape. It should not be too sticky. turn out on a lightly
floured board and knead until smooth and velvety, about 10- 12
minutes. Divide the dough into two equal parts and shape into balls.
Place in two buttered bowls, turning to coat the dough with the
butter.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk,
about 1 1/2 hours. Place on a buttered baking sheet, cover and let
rise again until doubled in bulk, about 40 minutes. Bake in a
preheated 400o oven about 45 minutes or until the loaves sound hollow
when tapped with the knuckles. Ten minutes before the loaves are
done, brush the tops with the egg wash. cool, covered with towels to
prevent the crust from hardening.

Flaky Cheese Twists

appetizers, breads

2 1/2 cup instant flour (wondra)
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup unsalted butter,chilled>>>>>
1  cut into bits.
1/2 cup ice water, or as needed
1 cup cheddar cheese, fine grate
1 teaspoon paprika (med-hot if avail.)
3/4 teaspoon coarse (kosher or sea) salt
2 tablespoon dry bread crumbs,fine
1  egg
1 tablespoon water

Whisk together the flour and 1 ts. salt thoroughly. Add the butter
bits and, using your fingers or pastry blender, blend into flaky
mixture. Sprinkle ice water gradually and mix lightly with a fork.
Add just enough water to make the dough bits adhere to each other;
don't overmix. Form dough into brick, wrap in plastic, and chill for
at least 1 hr or as long as 12 hrs.

When ready to bake the twists, halve the pastry, return one-half to
'fridge, and roll remaining half on lightly floured surface to make
rectangle 8 x 12". Turn pastry so that a long side faces you and
brush off all surplus flour, then fold pastry like a book where the
ends meet at the center.  Roll folded pastry out again, this time to
an oblong 7 x 10". Stop at any point and refigerate dough if it
becomes too soft. Dough MUST remain cold.

Cover large baking sheet with wax paper and sprinkle lightly with
flour. Lay pastry on paper and roll out to 9 x 12". Chill. Roll and
fold second half of pastry. Chill both halves, uncovered, for 30 min.
or cover loosely and chill up to 12 hrs.  Combine cheese, papprika,
coarse salt, and bread crumbs in a bowl. Beat egg with 1 tbs. water
in another bowl. Preheat oven to 400 F.

Slide one sheet of dough, on its wax paper, onto the work surface.
Brush lightly with egg mixture and sprinkle with 1/4 cup of cheese
mixture, pressing into surface. Cover with sheet of wax paper and
turn dough over. Peel off wax paper from top, then coat surface with
egg and another 1/4 of cheese mixture, pressing it in as before.

Quarter sheet of dough (pastry wheel or pizza cutter), then cut each
quarter into strips 1/2" wide and 4" long. Twist each strip to pencil
thinness (they will lengthen as you twist) and place them 1/2" apart
on ungreased baking sheet. Press ends of twists onto pan to prevent
unrolling.

Bake abt. 10 min., until the sticks are golden brown, then remove to
racks to cool.  When cool, trim off any unsightly flattened ends.
Repeat forming and baking proceedure for the second half of the
dough. Store airtight for up to 2 wks in the 'fridge or 1 wk. at room
temp. Baked twists may be frozen.  However stored, they improve with
brief warming before serving. Yield:  5 dozen sticks

Flame-Toasted Whole-Wheat Tortillas

breads, vegetarian

6  whole-wheat tortillas - butter (opt; ional)
1  flavored oil -or- melted

Keywords: Breads, Vegetarian, Vegan, Lacto, Southwest

If you haven't tried flame-toasted wheat tortillas you're in for a
treat. Like toast they can be topped in endless ways.

Place a tortilla directly over a medium high gas flame, or place on a
cookie rack set over an electric burner. Toast until surface becomes
lightly flecked with char, about 10 to 20 seconds, and tortilla
begins to fill with steam.  Turn over and toast the other side. A
perfect tortilla will fill with steam and puff up if it has no tears
or holes.

If desired, brush tortilla with oil or butter.  Place in a towel-lined
basket while toasting the remaining pieces. Serve piping hot.

Flour Tortillas (Making)

breads

2 cup unbleached all-purpose
1  flour
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/3 cup vegetable shortening
2/3  to 3/4 cup very hot water

Since tortillas freeze well, you can make a batch on a leisurely day
and have a supply on hand. Mix the flour with the salt and baking
powder. Using your hands, mix in the shortening until the mixture
becomes a coarse, even meal. Mix in 2/3 cup of the water, adding it
all at once, and knead for 2 minutes, or until the dough has the
consistency of a stiff bread dough. If dry and crumbly, add extra
water; if too moist, add a few tablespoons of additional flour. Cover
the dough and allow it to rest for 20 minutes.

Heat a skillet, saute pan, or griddle over medium-high heat until hot
enough that a drop of water immediately sizzles and evaporates.

You will be rolling and then cooking each tortilla, rather than
rolling them all and then cooking them. Pinch off a piece of dough
the size of a golfball and dust your hands and the dough ball with
flour. Place the ball on a floured surface and flatten the ball with
your hands into a circle 1/2 inch thick. Then, using a rolling pin,
roll it twice in the same direction and form a circle 1/8 inch thick
and about 8 to 9 inches in diameter. Immediately place it in the hot
skillet and cook it for 30 to 45 seconds, or until bubbles begin to
form on the top. If the tortilla puffs up into a pillow, push it down
with a spatula. Turn and cook 20 seconds, remove with a spatula, and
keep warm by placing it in a tea towel and covering it with the
towel. Roll and cook remaining dough the same way.

TO SOFTEN FLOUR TORTILLAS: Flour tortillas, like corn tortillas,
become brittle when cold, and must be softened to become pliable for
bending into quesadillas or rolling for chimichangas. To soften, heat
a dry skillet, saute pan, or griddle over medium heat. Heat a
tortilla for about 30 seconds, or until bubbles start to appear on
top. Turn and heat the second side for about 15 seconds. Fold or roll
immediately.

Flour Tortillas 1

breads

4 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoon vegetable shortening (or lard)
2 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoon salt
2 cup tap-hot water

Combine all ingredients except water.  Add water slowly, until dough
is soft, but does not stick to hands. Knead dough until satiny.
Softer dough is easier to roll. Make 2 inch balls of dough, and
flatten, roll on floured surface with a light rolling pin. Cook on
cast iron griddle, that has been preheated.  Griddle should be hot
enough to burn dough in less than 20 seconds.   Adjustments are
neces- sary, especially on electric stoves. Heat is approximately 300
F. Yield: 1 dozen.

Food Processor Brioche

breads

1 pkg active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (105f-to-115f)
2 1/3 cup bread flour
1/3 cup sugar
3/4 cup butter  cool but not hard-chilled
3  eggs
      ----GLAZE----
1  egg yolk; beaten, mixed with
2 tablespoon water

GREASE AND FLOUR 10 small fluted 1/3-cup brioche tins. Or use 1 3-cup
brioche pan. Dissolve yeast and a pinch of sugar in warm water. In
food processor or mixer, add flour and the rest of the sugar. Beat in
the cool butter. Add yeast and water; beat in the 3 eggs, 1 at a
time. Beat until shiny and glossy, and the dough forms long slick
strings with an adhesive quality. If the food processor turns off,
the dough is ready. Place it in an oiled plastic bag or oiled bowl;
turn to coat. Seal or cover. Let rise in a warm place until tripled.
Punch down and let rise again covered, in the refrigerator for 6
hours or overnight. Take 2/3 of the now-spongy dough and, working
quickly, form into balls. Put balls in tins. Cut a deep cross in the
center of each ball. With remaining dough, form small pear-shaped
knobs. Fit the pointed ends of the knobs into the center of each
cross, pressing firmly in place. Let rise, uncovered, in a warm place
until the dough doubles.

PREHEAT OVEN to 375F. Brush dough with egg glaze. Bake 20 minutes, or
until browned. For a quick brioche, cover dough in the greased bowl
with plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour in the refrigerator. Grease
brioche forms or muffin tins. When dough is chilled, knead it with
floured hands. It should not require any more flour. Shape. Brush all
over with glaze. Let double 15 to 20 minutes, and bake in a 400F
oven, about 10 minutes or until brown.

3 cup bread flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon walnut or vegetable oil
1 1/2 cup walnut pieces; toasted
      ----FOR GLAZE, COMBINE----
1 large egg; frothed with fork
1/2 teaspoon salt

STIR YEAST AND SUGAR into warm water; let stand until foamy, about 5
minutes. Put both flours, salt and oil into food processor work bowl
fitted with metal blade. Turn processor on to combine mixture. With
processor running, slowly add yeast mixture. Mix until dough cleans
sides of bowl. If dough is too sticky, add more flour by the
tablespoon, working it in before adding more. If dough is too dry and
crumbly, add more water by the teaspoon, working it in before adding
more. Once desired consistency is reached, process dough until well
kneaded, uniformly supple and elastic, about 40 seconds. Add walnut
pieces and process for 10 seconds. Remove blade. Then remove dough
from bowl and press all loose walnuts into it. Transfer dough to
large plastic bag, squeeze out air and seal at top. Place dough in
bowl. Let rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. Oil baking
sheet. Punch dough down and shape into smooth ball. Place round side
up on baking sheet. Cover loosely with oiled plastic. Let rise in
warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. 15 minutes before baking,
preheat oven to 400F, with rack in center of oven. When loaf has
doubled, slash loaf for surface design. Lightly brush with glaze.
Bake until loaf is deeply browned and sounds hollow when rapped on
the bottom, about 35 minutes. Immediately remove from pan to cool on
rack.

NOTE: (To toast nuts, spread single layer on jelly roll pan and bake
in 350F oven until fragrant and toasted, 8-to-10 minutes, watching
carefully to avoid burning)

Foolproof Sourdough Starter 3

breads, sourdough

1 tablespoon active dry yeast
2 1/2 cup warm water
2 1/2 cup white flour, preferably unbleached

Let yeast dissolve in 1/2 cup warm water in a pottery or glass bowl,
then stir in flour and 2 cups warm water; mix well. Pour into
plastic, glass, or crockery container, cover, and let stand 3-5 days
in a warm place - near but not directly over the stove pilot light is
a good choice.

When the mixture is ready to use, it may be stabilized by being kept
in the refrigerator.  When the liquid rises to the top, mix gently
with a fork to blend before using.

Feed the starter every 5 days by mixing in 1/2 cup flour and 1/3 cup
warm water.

Each time the starter is used, reserve at least 1 cup, replacing the
amount you have taken out with equal amounts of flour and water.

Fougasse Aux Grattons (Flat Bread With Crackl

breads, meats

1 each pkg active dry yeast
1 lb flour*
250 ml tepid water
1 each egg yolk, beaten
1 lb belly of pork, diced
2 lb pork fat, diced
12 tablespoon dry white wine

*Flour should be a mixture of unbleached white bread flour with 2
generous handfuls of buckwheat flour, sifted together. If you can't
find the buckwheat flour, don't worry about it.

For the dough: Stir together the yeast and a handful of flour in
enough water to make a runny batter. Leave for 1 hour. Warm the
remaining flour in the oven, mix in salt and make a well in the
middle. Pour in the yeast mixture and add enough tepid water to make
a moist dough. Knead for 10-12 minutes on a lightly floured surface.
Leave to rise in a large floured bowl covered with a dampened cloth.
When the dough has doubled in size, turn out onto a floured work
surface, punch down and flatten the dough out. Add the grattons (see
immediately below for how to make them). Preheat the oven to
450F/250C.

For the grattons: Cook the meat, fat and wine over a *very* gentle
heat in a heavy covered saucepan. Press down on the meat several
times during cooking to render up as much fat as possible. After 1
1/2 - 2 hours, pour the liquid off through a strainer. (It can be
used instead of olive oil for cooking, and often was, in Provencal
cooking.) Crisp the diced meat over higher heat, straining off any
liquid fat when necessary.

To make the fougasse, make the bread dough, and after the first
rising mix in the grattons. Then, with a knife, cut through the dough
first one way, then another. Reform into a ball and repeat. Gather
the pieces together into a mass, divine in two and form into two flat
loaves, slashed straight through their thickness in numerous places.
Spread the holes wider with your fingers. (You are striving for an
effect like a flat sheet of bread with holes like those of a slice of
swiss cheese.) Brush the top with the egg yolk and bake on a hot
metal sheet for 30-35 minutes until crisp and golden. Serve warm with
a bitter salad like endive or dandelion.

NB:  this is a very rich bread -- more like a salty shortbread than
anything else.  But *very* good.

Four-Way Sweet Bread Dough

breads

2 cup starter *
4  to 6 egg yolks plus warm water to m; ake 2 cups
1 1/2 cup cold water
1 1/2 cup white flour
1/2 cup sugar
3 cup white flour
1/2 cup warm water
1/2 cup soft lard
1 teaspoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pkg dry yeast
5 cup white flour
1 cup dried skim milk powder
1/2 teaspoon ginger

*Use Grated Raw Potato Starter

Empty starter from glass jar into large mixing bowl (do not use metal
or plastic).  Add 1-1/2 cups cold water and 1-1/2 cups white flour.
Beat thoroughly. Cover tightly (clinging transparent wrap is good)
and set in warm place (about 80) overnight.  Wash and scald starter
jar and lid. Allow to air out overnight. In the morning stir the
starter thoroughly. Pour off 2 cups and set aside. Pour remaining 2
cups into glass jar, cover and return to refrigerator. Mix the 1/2
cup warm water, 1 tsp. sugar, 1/2 tsp. ginger and 1 pkg. yeast. Set
in warm place until foaming nicely. Pour the 2 cups reserved starter
into mixing bowl.  Add 1 cup dried skim milk. Beat the egg yolks (the
more yolks the more tender and flaky the texture) in a measuring cup
and add enough warm water to make 2 cups. Add to the starter mixture
with 1/2 cups sugar and 3 cups white flour. Beat well. Add the dry
yeast mixture as soon as it is ready and beat thoroughly. Add 1/2
cups soft lard, 1-1/2 tsp. salt and 3 cups white flour. Stir until
the dough clears the bowl. Spread the remaining 2 cups white flour on
the pastry board. Turn out dough and knead thoroughly using a little
more flour if necessary to make a smooth nonsticky but not to stiff
dough. Return to the bowl. Grease top of dough, cover and set in warm
place to rise. When light turn out dough and knead well. Divide into
four even portions to make up in the following ways:  Old World Lemon
Cookies, Grenadine Slices, Cardamom Rolls and Raisin Log.  (If
fillings have been prepared ahead of time and the other ingredients
needed set out while the dough is rising it will take only about 20
minutes to get all of these made up and into the pans. If they are
made in order listed they will be ready for oven at spaced intervals.)

Frankfurter Buns

breads

2 cup milk
1/4 cup sugar
2/3 cup lard
3 teaspoon salt
2 pkg active dry yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
1 cup ; warm water, (115 deg. f.)
10 1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
2 large eggs

Scald the milk in a 1-quart saucepan, over medium heat. Meanwhile
combine the sugar, lard and salt in a large mixing bowl and set
aside. Pour the milk over the sugar mixture and cool to lukewarm.
Sprinkle the yeast and 1 ts of sugar over the lukewarm water,
stirring to dissolve. Let stand for 10 minutes to proof, (become
foamy). Add the yeast mixture, 5 c of the flour, and the eggs to the
milk mixture. Beat for 2 minutes, using an electric mixer set to
Medium speed. Gradually stir in enough of the remaining flour to make
a soft dough. NOTE: The dough should be light and slightly sticky and
not heavy. This is very important because if you have to much flour
in the dough, the bread will not rise correctly. Turn the dough out
and let rest while you wash, dry and lightly grease the mixing bowl.
Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and satiny,
about 8 to 10 minutes.  Place the dough in the prepared bowl, turning
once to grease the top of the dough.  Cover and let rise in a warm
place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch the dough down and divide
into fourths. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Roll each fourth
into a 9 X 4-inch rectangle. Cut into 9 (4 X 1-inch) strips. Roll
each strip to form a 5 1/2-inch cylinder. Place on greased baking
sheets, about 3-inches apart, and flatten slightly with the palm of
your hand. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake
in a preheated 350 Degree F. oven for 18 minutes or until golden
brown. Remove from the baking sheets and cool on racks. When cold to
the touch, wrap in foil until ready to use.

Fraser Canyon Bannock

1 cup flour

1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon baking powder
2 tablespoon brown sugar
2 tablespoon lard
2/3 cup water

Mix together dry ingredients; cut in lard with a pastry blender until
mixture resembles fine crumbs. Sprikle water over pastry, a little at
a time, stirring with a fork until mixture forms a soft dough. Turn
dough out onto a light floured board. Knead about 10 times. Roll out
to 1/2 inch thick circle; place on a greased baking sheet. Bake at
450 for 10-15 minutes until golden. Cut in wedges and serve hot with
butter.

** This is the city slicker method, now on to the "native" method,
the one that native Indians used long before the white man came to
the Caribou.*

Same ingredients.  Put in bowl and mix with hands until thoroughly
combined. Work with dough until it feels soft and satiny, about 3-5
minutes.  Take handful of dough and pat between palms until you get a
saucer sized form. Wrap around sturdy stick and cook over open camp
fire until golden brown. Can be eaten alone, broken in pieces and
buttered and jammed, or if you want to get fancy, stuff with cooked
ground beef mixture. The best way to eat it is at night when the kids
have gone to bed, and you are sitting around the campfire swapping
horror stories. Eat it plain, it is fantastic.
