Plain Old Bread

breads

1/2 oz yeast (dry), quick-rising (2 envelo; pes)
1/4 cup water, lukewarm
7 tablespoon milk, dry
2 1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cup water
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
6 cup flour, all-purpose

In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in about 1/4 cup lukewarm water.

In a large mixing bowl, mix the powdered milk, sugar, salt and about 1 3/4
cups water together.  Stir with a whisk until smooth, then add yeast
mixture.

Sift in about 3 cups of flour and mix until smooth.  Add the oil; mix.

Gradually sift in the remaining flour.  When it becomes stiff enough to
handle remove from the bowl and knead it as you add the flour. Knead it for
5-7 minutes after the last flour is added.

Place the dough in a oiled bowl and turn it over to coat uniformly. Then
place it in a warm place to rise until it has doubled in size (about 45
minutes).

Remove from bowl and knead a little.  Divide into two equal parts, shape
into loaves, and place in loaf pans. Let rise again until doubled in size.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Bake 45 minutes.  Remove loaves from pans
and cool on a wire rack.

NOTES:

*  Ordinary white bread -- This recipe is derived from the basic bread in
the American Heart Association Cookbook.

*  This is good everyday bread.  Be careful:  it's easy to eat too much and
get fat.  You may want to have someone who has made bread before help the
first time as the amount of flour may have to be adjusted depending on the
slight differences in your measurement of the liquids and the humidity of
the day. Once you have done it it is easy to do by the feel of the dough.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 2 hours rising, 1 hour cooking and
cooling.
: Precision:  measure carefully.

Pogaca (Farmer's Bread)

breads

1/4 cup fat
2 lb plain flour
1  salt
2/3 cup yeast cake
1 1/3 cup water

Rub fat in 1-1/2 pounds flour; add salt and yeast previously
dissolved in a little lukewarm water and mix. Knead well,
occasionally sprinkling the dough with the remaining flour. Dough
must be neither stiff nor soft. Roll the dough out into the size and
shape of a round baking dish. Oil or grease and flour the baking dish
and place the dough in it. Cover. Let it rise for 15 minutes. Prick
with fork, starting 1 inch from the edge and making circles spaced 1
inch from another. If desired, brush with egg yolk. Bake in a hot
oven (425 F) about 1 hour. When it is half done, set the oven on
moderate.  Serve Pogaca cut into a long narrow strip.

Pogaca is often served hot as an appetizer instead of bread. Hot
pogaca filled with sour cream is considered a particularly delicious
specialty.

Polish Corn Bread

breads

      ----SOURDOUGH STARTER----
2 cup cold water
6 cup rye flour
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
      ----BREAD----
4 cup warm water (105-110 f)
5 1/2 cup rye flour
5 1/2 cup all purpose flour
2 tablespoon salt
4 pkg dry yeast dissolved in 1/4 cup warm; water (105-110f)
1/4 cup ground cornmeal
2 teaspoon caraway seeds

1. Start sourdough starter at least 3 days before baking: Combine the
cold water, rye flour, and yeast in a bowl. Mix well; it will be
lumpy. Pour the mixture in a clean bowl, cover with a cloth, and
refrigerate for 3 days. 2. Remove the starter from the refrigerator 2
hours before beginning to make the bread. 3. Transfer the starter to
a large bowl and add the warm water, yeast, flours, salt, cornmeal
and caraway seeds and mix until smooth, 5 minutes. 4. Divide the
dough in half. Shape into 2 even rounds. Place each round in a
lightly greased bowl, cover with a clean cloth, and set aside to rise
in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1-2 hrs. 5. Place a
roasting pan on the bottom of the oven and fill with hot water.
Preheat the oven to 400F. Sprinkle a baking sheet with corn- meal. 6.
Dampen your hands and reshape the bread into even round mounds. Place
the loaves on a prepared baking sheet. Bake the bread until crusty,
about 2 hours. If the water in the roasting pan runs low during the
baking, replenish it to provide the bread with steam heat. Cool, or
serve warm. Makes 2 large loaves.

Poor Knights - Heirloom Recipe From 1300's Br

breads, desserts, heirloom, british

4  thick slices of bread
2  eggs beaten
200 ml white wine [or milk]
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 1/4 tablespoon sugar
1  oil for frying
1  confectioners sugar to serve
1  cinnamon to serve

This dish originated during the middle ages in England and spread all
over the world with many variations. Traditionalists should use
bread, but stale cake is a good substitute. Red wine can be used
instead of white. Substitute milk for wine and you have a more
recognizable dish called, incorrectly, french toast.

Bread: Cut off crusts and cut into quarters. Place in a deep dish.
Mix eggs with wine, cinnamon, and sugar in a bowl. Pour, once mixed,
over the bread and leave to soak for 3 minutes. Heat the oil [1/4
inch deep]. Drain the bread and slide it into the hot oil {Watch your
hands as it 'spits'}. Fry until golden brown on both sides Drain on
absorbent kitchen paper. Sprinkle with confectioners sugar and ground
cinnamon. From Ron's Plaice in Blackpool:) Feb 1996.

Portuguese Sweet Bread (Pao Doce [part 1])

breads

2 pkg active dry yeast
1 1/4 cup warm water (110 - 115 degrees), div; ided
3/4 cup sugar, divided
1/3 cup low fat dry milk
5 1/2  to 6 cups bread flour, divided
1 teaspoon salt
3  eggs, slightly beaten
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, room temperature
1  egg for glaze coarsely granulated s; ugar
1/4 cup dried currants (optional)

Dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup of the water in large bowl of mixer.
Sprinkle 1 tsp of the sugar on top and let stand until bubbly, about
5 minutes. Stir in remaining water, sugar, dry milk and 2 1/2 cups of
the flour. Beat on medium speed 2 minutes. Reduce mixer speed to
slow, and add salt, eggs and butter. Blend well. Add remainder of
flour a little at a time. When dough begins to get stiff for beaters,
change to dough hook. Enough flour is added when mixture forms a soft
ball which gathers around dough hook and follows hook around bowl. If
mixer doesn't have a dough hook, mix by hand with a spoon. Add flour
in a circle around bowl, rather than in the middle. Knead dough on
slow speed 5 minutes or 8 - 10 minutes by hand. Put dough in greased
bowl, turning to grease top. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in
warm place until double, 1 1/2 - 2 hours. Punch down dough, divide
into halves. CARACOIS (SMALL LOAF): Use half of dough. Roll into rope
about 25 x 1 1/2 inches. Twist rope and coil into greased round layer
pan. 9 x 1 1/2 inches, to form a snail shape. TRANCA A TRICANA (BRAID
LOAF): Use half of dough.  Work 1/4 cup dried currants into dough.
Cover with towel and let rest 30 minutes. Divide dough into 3 equal
parts, roll each into a 14 inch rope.  Lay ropes side by side on
greased baking sheet. Starting in middle and working out to each end,
weave into thick braid. Pinch ends together and turn under slightly.
TO BAKE: Cover and let rise until double, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Heat
oven to 350 degrees. Brush top with beaten egg, sprinkle with coarse
sugar. Bake until golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes. Makes 2 loaves

Potato Cakes (Bakestone Recipes)

breads, vegetables, breakfast

1 lb cooked floury potatoes
1 teaspoon salt
2 oz butter, softened
4 tablespoon self-raising flour
1  butter for filling

Potato cakes are eaten with bacon and sausages.  It's easier to make
them with hot, freshly cooked potatoes. If using cold potatoes, melt
the butter before adding it. Choose a floury type of potato, and boil
in well-salted water. -- Drain the cooked potatoes well, then return
to low heat in the same pan:  put a dishcloth over the pan and allow
the potatoes to dry for 5-10 minutes.  (This is called "drying in
their steam" in Ireland.) They should be dry and floury at the end of
the process. Sieve or rice into a mixing bowl with the salt. Beat in
the butter. Work in sufficient flour to make a soft dough which is
easy to handle. Turn onto a floured board and roll or pat out to 3/4
inch thick. Cut into rounds with a 3-inch scone cutter.  Place on the
hot greased bakestone and cook over a moderate heat until golden
brown underneath. Turn and cook the other side. Remove from the
bakestone, split, butter generously, and close again. Keep warm while
cooking the next batch. Serve hot. (Re "self-raising flour": in
Ireland and the UK, this is flour which comes with baking
powder/baking soda already included.  For this recipe, about 1/4-1/2
t of baking powder mixed with a plain all-purpose flour will
substitute nicely.)

Potato Foccacia

breads, snacks, italian, bakery

      ----CRUST----
1/2 tablespoon yeast
1 cup lukewarm water
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon parsley
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon wheat germ
3 cup flour
      ----TOPPING----
3 medium potatoes, diced
1 1/2 tablespoon olive oil
1  salt & pepper
1  olive oil, for brushing
1  parsley, chopped

In a mixing bowl, combine the yeast, water, sugar, salt, oil &
parsley. Let stand until the yeast starts to froth. Mix in the wheat
germ & 1 c flour. Beat well & let sit for 5 minutes. Knead in the
remaining flour & knead until the dough is soft & pliable. Lightly
oil a clean bowl & cover with a towel.  Let rise until doubled in
bulk.

Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet & saute the potaotes until
they are soft.  Remove from heat & set aside. Preheat oven to 350F.

Roll out the dough to fit into a cookie sheet or on a pizza stone.
Lightly sprinkle the cookie sheet with cornmeal & place the dough on
the sheet. Stretch into the corners & build up the edges slightly.
Let rest for 10 minutes.

Brush the dough with olive oil & spread the potatoes over the top.
Generously salt & grind fresh black pepper over the top & finish with
the fresh parsley. Bake for 25 minutes or until the crusts are done.
Cut up & serve immediately or let cool.  This is equally good cold &
served at room temperature.

NOTE: I think that this recipe still needs something to pick it up a
little if you have any ideas, please let me know. It is based on a
recipe a friend of mine ordered in Glasgow in an Italian Restaurant,
she apparently orders it a lot, I had never seen it before. There is
a lot of starch, but don't let that put you off. I found it better
cold than hot, but that may be my preference.

Potato Pancake Bread (Lompe)

breads, ethnic, pancakes

2 lb (6 medium sized) old potatoes (the; older, the better)
1 tablespoon salt
1/4 lb (1 cup) flour

This excellent soft pancake wrapper, easily made at home, is eaten in
Norway with butter and 'geitost' cheese, or used to wrap delicious
little morsels of smoked ham, 'fenalar', dried and salted leg of
mutton, or a spoonful of berry conserve.

You will need a griddle or a heavy frying pan, or best of all, a
'takke'. Boil the potatoes in their skins. Peel them as soon as they
are cool enough to handle and immediately mash them with the salt.
Speed makes light pancakes.  Mix with the flour into a dough. (Less
or more flour may be needed - potatoes are very variable. The less
flour you use, the better.) Form into a long sausage and chop of
lengths. Roll these pieces out into pancakes about 1/8 inch thick.

Bake the 'lompe' on a hot iron surface.

Yield:  Makes 10 to 12 small pancakes Time: 1 hour

Potato Sourdough Starter

breads

1 pkg dry yeast warm water
2 tablespoon sugar
4 cup flour
1  potato; raw quartered

Here is a recipe from Texas Highways Cookbook.

Dissolve yeast in warm water; and then mix all ingredients in a
1-gallon crock.  (Do not use metal container) Cover with a
close-fitting lid and let the starter rise until light (12 hours in
warm weather, longer in cool weather). Do not let the starter get
cold, ever. After using part of the starter, add 1 cup warm water, 2
teaspoons sugar, and enough flour to mix to the starter's original
consistency.  Add more potato occasionally as food for the yeast, but
don't add more yeast. Use daily for best results. Starter improves
with age. I am sure you will get some posts for flake starters.  I do
not have one.

2 tablespoon butter
1/3 cup butter or margarine; melted
1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

allow to rest for 10 minutes.   Roll out to a rectangle 30 inches
long by 20 inches wide. Spread with filling, to 1 inch from the edge.
Starting from wide side, roll up tightly, as for jelly roll.  With
palms of hands, roll back and forth so that roll is even all over. On
large greased cookie sheet, form roll into a large coil, seam side
down. Let rise in warm place (85 F), covered with towel, free from
drafts, until double in bulk, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 F and

Povatica Bread

breads

1 cup very warm water (105 f to 115f)
2 pkg active dry yeast
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/3 cup instant nonfat dry milk (in dry for; m)
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup lightly salted butter or margarine,; at room
1  temperature
3 1/2 cup all-purpose flour (up to 4 cups)
1  walnut filling
2 tablespoon butter or margarine
1 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
4 cup walnut meats, ground (1 pound)
2 large eggs
2 teaspoon ground cardamom seed or cinnamon
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Combine the water,yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand for 2
minutes.  Add the dry milk, salt, butter, and 2 cups of the flour. Mix
until smooth and beat for 2 minutes. Let rise, uncovered for 30 to 45
minutes until bubbly.

Stir in 1 cup of the remaining flour.  Turn the dough out onto a
well-floured surface (using some of the remaining flour) and knead
for 4 to 5 minutes, until smooth and elastic, adding only as much
flour as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking.  The dough
should be soft.

Place the dough in a buttered bowl, turning once to bring the
buttered side up.  Let rise in a warm place until double in volume,
about 1 1/2 hours. Grease two
9 x  5 x 3-inch loaf pans.

Punch down the dough; turn out onto a lightly floured surface and cut
in half.  Cover and let stand for 5 minutes. Roll out 1 piece of the
dough to a rectangle 11 x 16 inches, stretching the dough and letting
it stick to the surface as necessary.  Spread half of the Walnut
Filling evenly over the dough to within 1 inch of the edges. Roll up
the dough like a jelly roll, starting from a narrow side. Turn the
edges under slightly and place the roll, seam down, in a prepared
pan. Repeat with the remaining half of the dough. Cover and let rise
for 1 hour or up to 1 1/2 hours. The dough may not swell to double in
volume.

Place the pans on a shelf near the top of an unheated oven and turn
on the oven to 325F.  Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until done. Place
the pans on a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes. Remove the loaves
from the pans and let them cool completely.

Makes two loaves.

WALNUT FILLING:

In a medium-sized saucepan, cook the butter and sugar over
moderately-high heat.  When the butter and sugar have melted and the
mixture is bubbly, remove the pan from the heat. Stir in the ground
walnuts, eggs, cardamom, and vanilla.  Cool the filling before using.

Makes about 3 cups of filling.

Pressure Cooker Ships Bread

breads

1 1/2 cup water & 2 tsp. salt or
1 cup water & 1/2 c. sea water
1  packet dry yeast or 1 tbls. dry yea; st
1 tablespoon honey or sugar
4 cup flour (2 c. can be whole wheat or o; ther flour)

Some notes on using a pressure cooker for baking: Method 1 - Uses the
pressure cooker as the loaf pan. Grease inside of cooker well and
sprinkle interior with cornmeal. If making sweet breads, omit the
cornmeal. Method 2 ~ Uses the pressure cooker as an oven. YOU MUST
REMOVE THE PRESSURE RELIEF PLUG AND RUBBER SEAL. The high
temperatures will damage them.

In all cases, a "flame tamer" should be used to prevent scorching.
Unless specified, water should be lukewarm.

Ships Bread - Method 1

Combine water, yeast, and honey and let stand without stirring. When
yeast has dissolved (about 5 minutes), stir and knead in flour. Let
dough rise in warm place until doubled in bulk. Punch down and turn
into the cooker. Allow to rise again until doubled. Bake over medium
flame for about 45 minutes. You can turn the loaf over half way thru
the baking to allow for more even browning.

Prsurate (Holiday Season Drop Doughnuts)

breads

2 lb flour
1 quart hot water (about)
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup brandy
2 teaspoon vanilla
1/2  nutmeg; grated
1 cup raisins
1  lemon (grated peel)
1/2 cup tepid water
6 teaspoon dried yeast
1 1/2 quart soy or other light oil - for frying

Place flour in large bowl (or on table) and into hole in middle, add
gradually about a quart of hot water as you blend. Beating as you go,
and sides are cleaned of batter, whip the batter thoroughly with the
wooden spoon and add water until the mixture begins to ball. Continue
whipping, as you gradually add the sugar, brandy, vanilla, nutmeg,
raisins and lemon zest (grated peel).

Lastly, blend in and whip 1/2 cup tepid water in which you let soak 6
teaspoons of dried yeast as you begin the recipe. Let batter stand
(about 15-20 minutes) while oil heats. Heat about 1 1/2 quarts soy
oil, or other light cooking oil, in pan at ideal depth of 2 1/2
inches. Whip the dough again.  Have teaspoon and cup warm water handy.

When oil is hot enough (stops squeaking), take a small fistful of
dough and squeeze upward a ball about double, filling the teaspoon
that had been dipped in the warm water, then drop in hot oil.
Continue, dipping spoon in water before scraping off the ball of
dough, until your pan surface is nicely filled but not crowded. Take
this opportunity to whip some more air into your dough.  You'll find
from time to time they have to be coaxed to stay turned.  When both
sides are golden brown, remove and let cool slightly before rolling
in confectioners' (fine) sugar to coat. They're best on cold nights
between sips of your favorite whiskey ("rakija").

Psomi': Greek Homemeade White Bread

breads, ethnic, yeast

5 lb flour, + or - if needed
3  yeast cakes
1 cup warm water
1/2 lb margarine softened
1 cup oil
1 cup milk, more if necessary
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
3  or 4 eggs ( optional
1  egg wash: 1 egg/1 tbs. milk
1  increase if needeed

As you can see by previous Greek bread recipes, the Greek Housewives
made plenty of bread. These recipes are directly from Greece and are
in fairly large quantity.However this and other bread recipes can
easily be halved for the smaller hosehold. All yeast breads freeze
well too.

Crumble yeast in the warm water and let dissolve. Beat the margarine
until light and mix into the flour and yeast mixture. Then stir in
the oil, sugar, salt, cinnamon, eggs if using ( a lighter baked good
) and the milk, adding " more if needed"  to produce a kneadable
nonsticky dough. Knead smooth and elastic. Cover in a large bowl and
let rise double. Punch down and let rise double again. Shape into 5
loaves and place in pans. Beat egg and milk together and brush
loaves. Slash top of each bread. Bake 400 for 15 minutes and then 375
for 30 to 40 minutes or until golden and done. Recipe can be halved
easily.

Puff Pastry

breads, misc

3 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup plain bleached cake flour
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup iced water (approximately)
6 1/2  sticks chilled sweet butter

Makes about 2 3/4 lbs dough, making a 36- by 12-inch rectangle 1/4"
thick. To measure flours, scoop dry measure cups into a container and
sweep off excess with the flat edge of a knife.  Rapidly cut the
butter into big dice; toss butter and flour together on your work
surface.  Mixing it rapidly with the flour, flatten the chilled
butter into lima-bean size. Do it by hand or in an electric mixer
with a flat beater. (A food processor cuts butter too small.)  If
butter has softened, chill everything 20 minutes.  Blend in 3/4 cup
of iced water, lifting and turning, adding droplets more until
mixture holds together.  A mess! Push, pat and roll dough into a
rough rectangle; flour the top lightly as necessary.  If it breaks
too much, sprinkle on drops of water.  It will look quite awful. When
the rectangle is 18" long, flip one end over onto the middle, then
the other end, like folding a letter, making 3 layers. Scrape and
flour work surface.  Turn dough so top flap opens on your right.
Push, pat and roll it again into a rectangle.  Clean rolling pin and
flour it lightly; if dough softens, refrigerate at once.  Again fold
the dough into 3; use a pastry sheet to help.  Again roll it out into
a rectangle.  To prevent it from sticking, keep dough floured, work
surface clean.  These rolls and folding into 3 layers are known as
"turns" -- you now have made 3 turns. Make the fourth turn, shoring
up the edges with side of rolling pin.  By this time, you have a real
dough.  Wrap and refrigerate for 45 minutes at least-- to relax it.
Complete the fifth and sixth turns and it is ready to roll out and
form. See also "Julia Child's Tips on Puff Pastry" and "Additional
Info on Puff Pastry".

Pugliese Bread

breads, italian

1/4 cup water
1 1/4 teaspoon yeast
13/16 cup starter (biga)
2 1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon salt
7 1/2 cup flour

Mix water and yeast together.  Let stand for 10 mins. Add Biga
(starter) and water.  Mix until creamy looking. It is not necessary
to get rid of strands of starter that occur.

Add all of the salt.  Stir until desolved.

Add flour. Mix 2-3 minutes (electric mixer) or mix 4-5 minutes (by
hand).

Dough will just barely pull away from sides of bowl. It should be very
sticky. Adjust water and/or flour as necessary.

Let rise in a lightly oiled bowl for 3+ hours, covered tightly with
lightly oiled plastic wrap. Dough will triple in volume.

Divide dough into four parts.

Roll each part into long strand.  Roll up along length, stretching
slightly. Turn dough sideways and roll to long string again. Roll up
into tight ball, tucking to ends under.

Let rise 1 hour, covered with towel.

Pre-heat oven to 450, with pan of water in the oven, about 20 minutes
before baking.

Lightly dust loaves with flour and place on flat cookie sheet.

Caution:  The oven will be steamy when opened.

Bake with pan of water for 15 minutes. Remove water pan.

Bake 20 more minutes. Loaf should sound hollow on bottom. On of the
best ways to eat this bread is by rubbing a slice with garlic, or
sprinkling with crushed fresh garlic or garlic powder. Then drizzle
virgin olive oil over the bread. Follow this with a light sprinkle of
Parmesan cheese.

Bread dough can be wrapped in plastic at any of the stages before
baking and frozen or refrigerated. Unfreeze and allow to thaw
completely. This seems to work best if done before the rolling of the
individual loaves.

If stored in refrigerator, allow ample room, as bread will rise in the
refrigerator!

1/2 cup pureed pumpkin or winter  squash
1 teaspoon salt
3 1/4 cup all purpose flour
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water

minutes of baking to ensure even brownness. Baker's note: This recipe
rates four stars.  It has a wonderful flavour, and a nice golden
brown colour. It would be good to serve at Thanksgiving dinner.

Pumpkin Bread Pudding

breads, desserts, fruits, puddings

4  eggs
3 cup whole milk
1 lb mashed pumpkin
1 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 1/2 quart torn bread pieces
1 cup dark raisins
1  boubon sauce:
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1  egg
1 cup sugar
2 tablespoon whole milk
1/2 cup bourbon

PUDDING: Beat eggs in a large bowl. Add milk and beat again. Stir in
pumpkin, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and vanilla. Add bread pieces
and press with your hands to submerge bread in the milk mixture. (If
you have the time, cover and refrigerate the mixture several hours or
overnight; break up the bread the next day and bake as directed; if
not, proceed as follows.) Set the mixture aside for 15 minutes. Use
your fingers to break up the chunks of bread. Set aside 15 minutes
and repeat. Add raisins. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Generously butter
a 2 quart baking dish. Fill the dish with bread pudding mixture and
bake for 1 hour, or until pudding is set. Serve warm, hot or cold
with hot bourbon sauce. BOUBON SAUCE: Use unsalted real butter for
the best bourbon sauce; margerine doesn't make a great sauce. Melt
butter in a bowl set over hot but not boiling water. Combine egg,
sugar and milk in a small bowl and beat until light colored. Add to
butter and beat with a whisk over hot water until sugar dissolves -
at least 5 minutes. Add boubon and stir. Remove from stove and serve.

2 cup all-purpose flour, divided
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup canned pumpkin
1/2 cup molasses
2  eggs
1/3 cup margarine
1/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon ground ginger

Stir together 1 cup of the flour, the brown sugar, baking powder,
cinnamon, and baking soda.  Add the pumpkin, molasses, eggs,
margarine, milk and ginger.  Mix vigorously until combined. Add the
remaining flour and blend in.  Divide the batter evenly among 4 small
loaf pans.

Bake in a 350 F oven for 40 to 50 minutes or until a wooden pick
inserted near the center of each loaf comes out clean.  Cool the
loaves in the pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. Remove the loaves
from the pans. Cool thoroughly on the wire racks.

To Freeze:  Wrap each loaf tightly in moisture- and vaporproof wrap.
Seal, label, and freeze for up to 6 months.  To thaw, let stand,
loosely covered, at room temperature for 1 hour.  Or, to micro-thaw,
place 1 unwrapped loaf on a microwave-safe paper towel.  Microcook,
uncovered, at 30% power (medium-low) for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.

Makes 4 loaves, 8 servings each.

Pumpkin Scones

breads, australian

1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup sugar
1  egg
2 cup flour, self-raising
1 cup pumpkin, cooked (cold), mashed
1/8 teaspoon salt

Grease a scone tray or baking tray.  Cream together the butter and sugar
until light and fluffy. Add egg and beat well.

Add pumpkin, flour and salt and fold in by hand.  Knead lightly and cut
into 1-inch squares. Place close together on the scone tray and bake at 425
degrees F. until well risen and golden on top (about 15 minutes). Serve
hot, with butter.

NOTES:

*  Pumpkin scones -- Scones (pronounced with a short `o', rhymes with
`Fonz') are a popular accompaniment to afternoon tea. They are often served
with jam and whipped cream. In this variation the scones are flavoured with
pumpkin. It is not a typical scone recipe.

Pumpkin scones can be eaten in place of bread with a meal.  This recipe was
made famous by the wife of the Premier of Queensland. Yield: Serves 4-6.

*  To an Australian, a pumpkin is a large round, squat, green or blue-green
vegetable that is orange on the inside.  There are many varieties, all of
species Cucurbita maxima.  In North America a good substitute is acorn
squash (Cucurbita pepo); elsewhere a butternut squash (Caryoka nuciferum)
would be a fair substitute.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 15 minutes baking.

Pumpkin-Black Walnut Biscuits

breads

2 cup unbleached all purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
2 tablespoon sugar
1/2 cup butter, cold
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/3 cup finely chopped black walnuts
1 teaspoon baking soda
2/3 cup canned or mashed cooked pumpkin
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup buttermilk, or a bit more if needed
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg

Sugar

"A batch of these intriguingly flavored biscuits is a nice addition
to any meal. This particular biscuit has a tendency to overbrown on
the bottom, so use a light-colored metal baking sheet instead of a
nonstick sheet. Serve the biscuits hot with butter."

Preheat oven to 450 F.  Sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder
and soda, salt, and spices into a large bowl. Cut in the butter (or
use food processor) until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add
the nuts. In a small bowl, whisk together the pumpkin and buttermilk.
Add it to the flour mixture and stir to combine. The dough will be
quite stiff and not all the flour will be incorporated. Turn the
dough out onto a lightly floured cloth and knead gently a few times
to work in the rest of the flour. Roll out the dough to a 1/2 inch
thickness and cut with a 2 inch round cutter. Transfer the biscuits
to a lightly oiled shiny baking sheet, and sprinkle tops with sugar.
Bake for 10 minutes--do not let them get too brown. Serve immediately
with butter.  If you must have jelly with the, choose a delicate
apple jelly so the subtle pumpkin flavor is not masked.

Quiche Pastry

breads, pies

1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoon cold butter; cut into small pieces
2 tablespoon vegetable shortening; cut into small pieces
4 1/2 tablespoon ice water

Place the flour, salt, butter and shortening in a large bowl. Rub the
flour and fat together until the fat is broken into pieces the size
of oatmeal flakes. Don't over-blend. Using a pastry knife, add the
ice water, a little at a time, mixing until it just starts to hold
together. Press the dough into a roughly shaped ball. Knead it
briefly into a fairly smooth ball, then sprinkle lightly with flour
and wrap in a sheet of waxed paper. Chill 1-2 hours in the
refrigerator. When ready to roll, sprinkle work surface and rolling
pin with flour and roll the pastry out into a circle 1/8" to 1/4"
thick.

Butter a 9" pie tin. Place the crust in the pan and press gently to
line the inside. Crimp edges. To partially bake the shell, line the
pastry with buttered, lightweight foil. Fill the center with dry
beans or rice. Bake in the middle level of a preheated 400F for
about 8-9 minutes or until the pastry seems set. Remove foil and
beans, prick bottom of the pastry with a fork, and return to oven for
2-3 minutes.

appetizers, breads, party

2 cup crescent rolls
1 pkg epperoni; chopped
2 cup cheese; sharp cheddar chees
1 single mayonnaise; hellman's or k
1/2 cup onion; dried minced

Are you looking for a pepperoni dinner roll? Sorry, I don't have a
recipe for those, but I have a recipe for pepperoni puffs. I use
these for at cocktail parties. If you like pepperoni, these are very
easy and delicious. They always disappear fast. Add enough hot water
to cover minced onion and let soak a few minutes until softened.
Drain well. Chop pepperoni in food processor.  Blend grated cheddar,
pepperoni and onions in small bowl. Add enough mayonnaise to moisten
well. Divide crescent rolls into four rectangles tangles, pinching
perforations together. Leaving a 1/2 inch border all around each
rectangle, spread the pepperoni mixture between borders.  Roll up
each rectangle into a log, pinching seams on all edges. Cut each log
into 1 inch rounds. Then cut each round in half. Put rounds into
greased miniature muffin tins.  Bake at 375 degrees for 8 minutes.
Remove immediately from tins using a spoon. Serve warm. (Can be
frozen and reheated).The variations you can add to this are
endless.Just to name a few: 1.Chopped green olives
2.Chopped Ripe olives 3.chopped canned mushrooms 4.grated
mozzarella cheese 5.grated Muenster cheese 6.crumbled Italian
seasonings I hope someone else will post something that you can use.

Quick Sourdough Starter

breads

2 cup flour
1 tablespoon yeast (1 package)
1 1/2 cup water 105 - 115 deg. f.

In a large bowl mix the yeast with the water and allow to proof for
about 10 minutes. If the yeast doesn't start to puff up and bubble,
discarded and start over with fresh yeast.

Sprinkle the flour into the yeast mixture and beat into a thick
batter. The batter doesn't have to be too smooth as the action of the
yeast will break down any lumps. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and
let stand in a warm (80-85 F or 25-30 C) place for about 24 hours, or
until it is nice and frothy. You can use the starter right away or
let it age for up to 3 days longer to develope a richer flavor. Store
starter in fridge between uses and use or replenish every two weeks.

You can use any flour or combination of flours to make the starter;
some rye and buckwheat added to all-purpose makes a nice blend.

To replenish the starter: mix equal parts of water and flour (about a
cup of each is good) and add to the starter at least every two weeks.
Let the starter age in a warm place for 6 to 24 hours, then use or
return to the fridge.

Rahn Salt-Rising Bread

breads

2 tablespoon corn meal
1/2 pint water
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 quart milk
1 teaspoon salt
8 cup flour (variable)

"Salt rising bread is leavened by the fermentation of flour and milk.
Bacteria are most important actors in this play. The yeast plants of
the air find the batter a good stage for development. Salt rising
bread needs more heat while fermenting and a much longer time to
bake. Here is a good example:"

Stir 2 Tbsp. of corn meal into 1/2 pint of water heated to 130 F. Add
1/2 tsp. of salt and mix very well. Put this in a jar or crock, cover
and place it in a pan of water at 160 F. Keep overnight in a warm
place.

In the morning, warm 1 quart of milk; add 1 tsp. salt and enough warm
flour to make a heavy batter. Gradually add the overnight corn meal
and beat well for a few moments.  Cover and keep in a warm place
about 2 hours.

Gradually add flour and beat mix until it becomes a very soft dough.
Turn out on a floured board and knead until it is elastically smooth.
Divide equally into four portions, mold into loaves, and place each
in a greased bread pan.  Cover with a clean cloth and keep in a warm
place for 1/2 hour. Bake in a 350 F. oven for 1 hour.

Raised Waffles

breads, breakfast

1/2 cup warm water
1 pkg dry yeast
2 cup milk; warmed
1/2 cup butter; melted
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
2 cup all-purpose flour
2  eggs
1/4 teaspoon baking soda

USE A RATHER LARGE mixing bowl--the batter will rise to double its
original volume. Put the water in the mixing bowl and sprinkle in the
yeast. Let stand to dissolve for 5 minutes. Add the milk, butter,
salt, sugar and flour to the yeast mixture and beat until smooth and
blended. You can use a hand-rotary beater to get rid of the lumps.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let stand overnight at room
temperature. Just before cooking the waffles, beat in the eggs, add
the baking soda, and stir until well mixed. The batter will be very
thin. Pour about 1/2-to-3/4 cup batter into a very hot waffle iron.
Bake the waffles until they are golden and crisp. This batter will
keep well for several days in the refrigerator.

Raisin English Muffins

breads, breakfast

1 pkg dry yeast
1 cup water; warm (105 to 115f)
1 cup milk
2 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon butter (or marg.); softened
1 cup raisins
5 1/2 cup all-purpose flour; (to 6cups)
1  cornmeal

Dissolve yeast in water in a large mixing bowl; let stand 5 minutes.

Combine milk, sugar, salt, and butter in a small saucepan. Cook over
medium-low heat, stirring until butter melts. Coll to likewarm (105
to 115 degrees).

Stir milk mixture, raisins, and 3 cups flour into yeast mixture; beat
until smooth.  Add 2-1/2 to 3 cups flour to form a stiff dough.

Turn dough out onto a floured surface, and knead 2 minutes or until
dough can be shaped into a ball (dough will be slightly sticky).
Place in a well-greased bowl, turning to grease top.  Cover and let
rise in a warm place (85 degrees) free of drafts, about 1 hour or
until doubled in bulk.

Punch dough down, and divide in half.  Turn each half out onto a
smooth surface heavily sprinkled with cornmeal. Pat one half of dough
into a circle, 1/2 inch thick, using palms of hands; cut dough into
rounds with a 2-3/4inch cutter. (Cut carefully, as any leftover dough
should not be reused.)

Sprinkle 2 baking sheets with cornmeal.  Transfer cut dough rounds to
baking sheets, placing 2 inches apart with cornmeal side down (one
side of dough should remain free of cornmeal). Repeat process with
remaining half of dough.  Cover and let rixe in a warm place (85F),
free of drafts, for 30 minutes or until doubled in bulk.

Using a wide spatula, transfer rounds to a preheated 360 degree,
lighlty greased electric skillet.  Place cornmeal side down; cook for
6 minutes. Turn and cook 6 additional minutes. Cool on wire racks.

To serve, split muffins and toast until lighlty browned. Store
muffins in an airtight container.

Note: Muffins may be cooked over direct medium-high heat in a skillet.

To ease the morning breakfast rush, the muffins can be prepared ahead
of time and stored in an airtight container; just split and toast
before serving.

1 cup golden or dark raisins
3 tablespoon vanilla sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon allspice
1  topping:
3 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon allspice
1 teaspoon cornstarch

* Use Grated Raw Potato Starter Roll the dough into a rectangle with
the width equal to the length of the pan (medium size loaf) and about
twice as long.  Brush with canned milk. Scatter raisins over surface.
Mix vanilla sugar, cinnamon and allspice together and sprinkle on
evenly. (if vanilla sugar is not available, dribble 1 tsp. of vanilla
extract over dough.) Roll up tightly but do not seal ends.  Place
seam-side down in pan. Butter top generously and push sharp pointed
knife down through the dough almost to bottom at regular intervals to
allow air bubbles between layers to escape. Set in warm place to rise
and when ready for the oven, spread with the well-mixed topping (the
cornstarch will help to bind the topping to the crust so that it will
not crack off badly when sliced). Bake in oven preheated to 350 for
50 to 60 minutes. Cool before slicing.

inches in diameter.  (If the humidity is high and the dough is very
sticky, you may need to add another 1/4 cup of flour to the board.)

Press the dough evenly into the prepared skillet or pan and cut a
cross 1/2 inch deep across the top. Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes,
or until the loaf sounds hollow when rapped on the bottom.  Remove
the loaf to a wire rack and rub the top with butter. Sprinkle with
sugar. Let the bread cool completely before slicing.

This Irish bread tastes even better the second day and is
particularly good for breakfast.

Makes one large loaf.

4 cup peeled, diced apples**
1 cup raisins or chopped walnuts
2 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger

batch is never enough so I always make a double batch.

apples can be used.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray cookie sheets with PAM or Baker's
Secret or lightly grease. Cream butter or margarine and sugars. Add
eggs, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla. Stir in baking
soda, cinnamon, ground ginger and cloves. Stir in apples, nuts and
raisins (if desired). Add the flour and mix well.

I start with 6 cups of flour and according to the humidity level that
day, I add up to an additional cup of flour. Drop by teaspoonful onto

Real White Bread

breads

1/4 cup :warm water (approx 105f)
1 pkg dry yeast
1 3/4 cup milk
2 tablespoon butter; softened
1  vegetable shortening or oil
2 tablespoon sugar
2 1/2 teaspoon salt
5 1/2 cup all-purpose flour (or more)

POUR THE WARM WATER over the yeast. Stir well, and let stand to
dissolve. Heat the milk, stirring, to the same temperature as the
yeast, then pour it over the dissolved yeast. Add the butter (or
shortening or oil), sugar, salt and 4 cups of the flour. Beat
vigorously with a large spoon for at least 1 minute. Stir in enough
of the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to make a stiff but not
dry dough. Dust the kneading surface with 1/4 cup of the reserved
flour and turn the dough out onto it, cleaning the bowl completely
with a rubber spatula. Knead the dough for 1 minute, sprinkling extra
flour a little at a time as necessary, then let rest for 10 minutes.
Resume kneading for about 6 to 8 minutes more, or until the dough is
smooth and elastic. Put in a lightly greased bowl, cover and let rest
in a warm place to rise for between 1 and 2 hours. When the dough has
doubled in bulk, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and punch
it down for a minute. Cut dough in half and pat each half into an
oval the approximate length of your bread pan, which should be
lightly greased. Put in the pan, cover with a damp towel and let rise
for another 45 minutes to 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350F and, when
the bread is risen, put it in the oven. Bake for about 40-to-45
minutes in a glass pan, or 45-to-50 minutes in a metal pan. Makes 2

addictive they are.  We had 2 left over in our bread basket; I took
them home and nibbled on them cold later that night while I played on
the *P board. I have not tried these myself, >>> but when this recipe

Red Lobster Cheese Biscuits

breads, biscuits

1 teaspoon garlic salt or powder
1 tablespoon parsley flakes
1 teaspoon italian seasonings
5 lb bisquick
44 oz ; water, cold
1 lb cheddar, sharp; grated
1/2 cup butter

Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Mix bisquick, water and cheese. Drop by
large spoonfuls onto greased baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes.
After baking, (while hot) brush on melted butter or margarine mixed
with garlic powder, parsley flakes and Italian seasoning. (Amounts
will vary by the size batch you make, but a little goes a long way.)
Serve hot. The RL manager's recipe is for a large quantity, so you'll
have to reduce the ingredient quantities by the size batch you
desire. Note: For a smaller batch I usually use 2 C. Bisquick, 1/2
cup cold water, and 3/4 c. grated cheddar which will yield about 12
biscuits. You may also substitute soda water or gingerale for the
water, if desired.

3 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup shortening; (crisco)

garlic powder, and some dried parsley. Bake for 12 - 15 minutes. When

breads, biscuits

2 cup bisquick? baking mix
1/2 cup cold water
3/4 cup sharp cheddar cheese; grated
1/4 cup butter
1 teaspoon parsley
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon italian seasoning

Bake 450 for 8-10 minutes, brush with the butter and spices - you

"Folks a wonderful person sent me the 'actual' recipe from Red
Lobster, so here it is. Its a lot easier than mine, so please give it
at try. The basic recipe is broken down for household rather than
their huge batch.

However, you cannot make the EXACT biscuits, because they have a
special butter/garlic sauce that is not available to the general
public. See how they are!!"

Red Lobster Inspired Garlic Cheese Biscuits

breads

1 cup milk
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon sugar**
2 cup self-rising flour*
1/4 cup kraft american cheese**
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder -- not salt
3 tablespoon melted butter or margarine
1  muffin paper liners

*You may use all-purpose (regular) flour, however biscuits will not
rise much and have a denser texture; flavors should be about
identical. **Can substitute 3 packets of Sweet & Low for the sugar.
Use the cheese in the gold cardboard container. Original recipe does
not say, but I would think you will want to shred it.

In a 1 1/2 qt mixing bowl combine the milk, mayo, sugar, and flour.
Beat on high speed with electric mixer for almost a minute, until
smooth and completely combined. Using a rubber bowl scraper, streak
the dough with the cheese. Batter should NOT be thin enough to pour;
if necessary, add only enough additional flour so batter will "drop"
from spoon. Drop batter into 10 paper-lined muffin tins, or a greater
number of tiny muffin cups. (Muffins tend to triple in size when
baked; fill lightly.) Melt butter; mix in garlic, and brush tops of
dough. You may shake 1 tsp additional cheese on each muffin if you
wish. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden. Cool in pan on rack
for 30 minutes.

These definitely should be served freshly baked and hot.

Red Pepper-Semolina Bread From Bread

breads

1 tablespoon rice yeast, saf instant one
1 tablespoon dough enhancer
2 cup warm water, 105 f to 115 f
2 cup semolina flour
2 large red bell peppers,
1  roasted & peeled
4 cup unbleached all-purpose
1  or bread flour
1/4 cup olive oil
1 tablespoon salt

1. Combine yeast, dough enhancer, water, semolina flour, red peppers,
2 cups of the unbleached flour and the oil in a heavy duty mixer
bowl. Mix just until ingredients are combined. Cover loosely and let
sponge for 15 minutes. 2. Add the salt. 3. With mixer on low speed
and using the remainder of the unbleached flour, add just enough
flour until the sides of the bowl are cleaned by the dough. The dough
should still be soft & sticky. 4. Knead on low speed for 7 minutes.
The dough will no longer be sticky but elastic. 5. Turn dough out
onto a lightly greased surface & form into two loaves. Place into 2
greased pans or onto a greased baking sheet sprinkled with corn meal,
if desired. Let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. 6. Bake in a
preheated 350 F oven for about 35-40 minutes. I substituted an equal
amount of applesauce for the oil and used jarred roasted red peppers
from Trader Joe's and used freshly milled Golden 86 flour instead of
unbleached flour.

2 tablespoon sugar
2 1/4 cup hot water (130 degrees f.)
2 pkg active dry yeast
1 tablespoon salt
1/4 cup butter or margarine **

*     Use up to this much flour.  Use only enough flour to make a soft
dough and to keep from sticking when kneading. ** Butter or margarine
must be at room temperature or use the same amount of vegetable oil.
In a large bowl mix 2 cups of the flour, the yeast, sugar, and salt.
Stir in the hot water and when mixed, beat with an electric mixer at
medium medium speed or with a wooden spoon for 2 minutes, scraping
sides of bowl occasionally.

speed or by hand for 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. With
wooden spoon, gradually stir in enough of the remaining flour to make
a soft dough.

Turn dough out on lightly floured surface (use some of the remaining
flour) and knead for 8 to 10 minutes until dough is smooth and
elastic, adding only enough flour to keep dough from sticking.

Cover dough with bowl and let stand 20 minutes.

In the meantime grease two 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 2 1/2-inch loaf pans or a
large baking sheet.

Uncover dough and knead briefly; divide in half and place in pans or
on baking sheet.  Brush 2 sheets of plastic wrap with oil and cover
loaves loosely.

Refrigerate for 2 to 24 hours.

When ready to bake, remove from refrigerator, uncover and puncture any
surface bubbles with a skewer or wooden toothpick. Place in an
unheated oven; turn on oven to 350 degrees F. Bake 40 to 60 minutes
or until done.

Rhubarb-Hickory Nut Bread

breads

1 cup coarsely chopped rhubarb
1 cup sugar
1 1/2 cup flour
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1  egg
2 tablespoon milk
4 tablespoon melted butter (1/2 stick)
1/2 cup coarsely chopped hickory nuts

Let the rhubarb steep in 1/2 cup of the sugar for 1 hour or more (even
overnight) stirring once or twice. Toss the remaining sugar and all
of the dry ingredients together to mix thoroughly. Beat the egg
lightly and stir into it 1/4 cup of the juice that the rhubarb will
have exuded after steeping, as well as the milk and melted butter.
Mix the dry ingredients into the wet, stirring just enough to mix.
Fold in the rhubarb (if there is still more juice, drain it off) and
the nuts. Scrape the batter into a buttered 8-inch loaf pan and bake
in a preheated 350 F oven for 1 hour. Let the loaf rest in the pan 10
minutes before unmolding, then cool it on a rack.

Makes one 8-inch loaf.

cubes and place in a bowl.  Heat the milk with 2 tablespoons of the
butter and pour over the bread cubes. Use the remaining butter to
coat a 1-quart casserole.  After the toast has soaked for 1- minutes,
beat together the eggs, maple syrup, 1/4 cup sugar, and salt, then
stir in the rhubarb and combine with the bread mixture. Pour into
buttered casserole, sprinkle remaining sugar on top and bake for 40
minutes in a preheated 325 F oven. Serve warm with maple-flavored
whipped cream. Serves 4.

Rich White Batter Bread

breads

1 1/2 cup milk
2 tablespoon sweet butter
2 tablespoon honey
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water
1 teaspoon sugar or honey
4  eggs
6 cup unbleached white flour

Makes 2 large loaves

In a saucepan scald the milk; add butter, 2 Tbsp honey, ginger and
salt. Cool.

In a large bowl dissolve the yeast in the warm water with the sugar or
honey.  When this is bubbly, add cooled milk mixture. Add eggs, one
at a time, beating well after each.

Add 3 cups of the flour and beat thoroughly for at least 5 minutes
with an electric mixer.  (A finer texture will result if you can let
this sponge sit, covered with a towel, for an hour or so.) Beat in 3
more cups flour or enough to form a mass which clings together,
leaving the sides of the bowl. You may have to resort to a wooden
spoon at this point.

Cover and let dough rise in its bowl until it has doubled in bulk.
Stir down with a wooden spoon and divide equally between two 9x5-inch
buttered loaf pans. You may feel like you are pulling taffy but don't
give up. Smooth the dough out as best you can with the spoon or your
hands. Cover and let the dough rise until it reaches the tops of the
pans. Preheat oven to 375F. Bake 25 - 30 minutes or until the loaves
sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.  Remove from the pans and put
directly on the oven rack for another couple of minutes baking.

Rigani Cheese Bread

breads, greek

1  karen mintzias
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1 cup tepid (110 f) water
3 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt
3 cup whole wheat flour, or more
2 tablespoon dried rigani; crumbled
1/2 tablespoon dried mint; finely crumbled
3/4 lb feta cheese; well drained,  finely cru
1  egg yolk; beaten with:
2 tablespoon warm water

Sprinkle the yeast over the water and set aside in a warm place until
foamy, about 10 minutes.  Whisk in 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and
the salt.

Sift the flour into a large mixing bowl, make a well in the center,
and pour in the yeast mixture.  Knead 10 minutes, adding additional
flour if necessary to make a firm elastic dough. Transfer to a
lightly oiled bowl, tightly cover with plastic wrap, and set aside
for 2 hours in a warm draft-free spot.

Knead in the rigani, mint, and feta until evenly distributed
throughout the dough.  Lightly oil a heavy baking sheet and place the
dough in the center. Form into a round loaf and flatten to a
thickness of 2 inches. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and set aside
for 1 hour in a warm draft-free spot. The dough will rise only
slightly.

Heat the oven to 350 F.

With a sharp thin blade, slash the top of the loaf diagonally in 2 or
3 parallel lines, brush with the remaining olive oil, and bake 25
minutes. Brush with the beaten egg yolk and bake 15 minutes longer,
or until the bread is deep golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped
on the bottom.

Roast Beef & Yorkshire Pudding

breads, meats

4 lb rib roast
2 tablespoon oil
      ----YORKSHIRE PUDDING----
3/4 cup flour salt
3/4 cup milk
1 tablespoon milk
2  eggs

"It used to be the custom to cook Yorkshire Pudding and the Roast
Beef in the same pan. Although it is rarely done today, Yorkshire
Pudding still taste best if it is cooked in the fat that the meat has
been cooked in, so that it absorbed with meat juices. Serve with
Horseradish Sauce." Preheat the oven to 450F. Place the beef fat side
up in the roasting pan and coat with oil. If you like your beef rare,
it should cook for 1 1/4 hours and the meat thermometer should
register between 130F and 140F. If you prefer it medium to well done,
it should cook for 1 1/2 hours and a meat thermometer should register
between 150F and 160F. Baste the meat frequently while it is cooking.
Meanwhile, prepare the batter for the Yorkshire Pudding. Sift the
flour and salt into a mixing bowl. Make a well in the centre and add
milk and the water gradually, beating well after each addition with a
wooden spoon.
In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until fluffy. Add them to the
flour mixture. Beat until bubbles rise to the surface. Pour the
batter in a pitcher and refrigerate for 1/2 hour.
When the meat is cooked, remove it from the pan and place it on a
warm platter. Cover with aluminum foil and let it stand 25 minutes
before carving.
Reheat the batter and pour it quickly into the still hot cooking
pan. Bake it in the oven for 10 minutes at 450F. Then reduce the heat
to 350F and cook it an additional 15 minutes, until it is well risen
and has turned a golden brown. (Do NOT open the oven door while it is
cooking.) Serve immediately from the pan in which it has been cooked.

1 pinch salt
1 pinch mixed spice
1 pinch grated nutmeg
2 oz currants
4 oz margarine
3 oz sugar
1 oz chopped candied peel
1 each egg

Measure baking powder into flour and add the salt. Sieve flour into

dried fruit and candied peel. Beat egg in basin and add to dry
ingredients, using the fork. You may need just a drop of milk.  Mix
all the ingredients very well together. The mixture should be fairly
firm and dry. Grease tin. Put mixture in small heaps on baking tin
and bake for 15 minutes in a hot oven (450F, mark 8).

Rosemary Olive Oil Bread

breads

1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 1/2 cup water -- 105-115 degrees
2 cup basic bread sponge
3 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1  extra virgin olive oil --
1  for brushing
3 cup unbleached all-purpose
1  flour
1/3 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1  for kneading
1/2 cup whole wheat flour --
1  preferably organic
1/4 cup fresh rosemary -- finely
1  chopped
2 tablespoon kosher salt
1  cornmeal -- for sprinkling

Measure the rosemary *after* chopping.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Place the walnuts on a baking sheet,
roasting until fragrant and golden brown, about eight minutes. Cool.

In a bowl, dissolve  the yeast in the water.  Allow to proof for three
minutes.

Stir the sponge and 3 tablespoons oil into the water, breaking the
sponge up using your hands or a spoon. Stir in the rosemary and salt.

Add 3 cups of the unbleached flour, the whole wheat flour, and salt
and mix, scraping and folding until the dough gathers into a single
mass which will be wet and sticky with strands hanging from your
fingers.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and allow to rest
for 3 minutes.  knead in as much of the 1/3 cup of flour as is
required to make a smooth, elastic and only slightly sticky dough
(use as little flour as is possible).  Shape into a ball.

Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, brush the top of the dough
with additional oil, and cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate
overnight.

Remove from the refrigerator and allow to warm-up in a draft-free
spot for two hours.

Sprinkle a baking sheet without sides generously with cornmeal. On a
floured work surface, halve the dough and then shape one piece into a
ball, pressing to remove any large bubbles at the edges. Place the
dough-ball on the baking sheet, being sure to put the seam on the
bottom. Repeat with the second ball, leaving 3 to 4 inches between
the two. Cover with plastic and allow to rise until doubled, in a
draft-free location. This should take 2-2 1/2 hours. These loaves
will be flat and wide.

Preheat the oven for at least thirty minutes along with a baking
stone or tiles on the middle rack to 425. Place a baking pan with
decent sides on the bottom shelf. Boil two cups of water. Brush the
loaves again with oil and then, using a razor blade, make a
tic-tac-toe pattern in the top of each of the loaves - do not tear
the dough, you want to cut it. Pour the boiling water into the baking
pan.  Slide the loaves off the sheet and onto the stone.

Bake for 20 minutes, reduce the temperature to 350 and then bake for
another 30-35 minutes until the loaves are a light golden brown and
hollow sounding when tapped on the bottom. When done, brush with
additional olive oil and transfer to cool on a rack.

Rosemary-Whole Wheat Focaccia With Garlic

breads, cheese

1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon cold water
1 3/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon honey
2 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoon dried rosemary leaves
1 cup whole-wheat flour
1/2 cup bread flour
1  oil and cornmeal for baking pans
3 tablespoon butter or margarine
2  lg. red onion, thinly sliced, slice; s separated into rings
1 1/2 cup finely shredded parmigiano-reggiano; cheese or other
1  parmesan-like hard cheese
1/4 cup finely julienned sun-dried tomatoes
1  salt
1  crushed hot red pepper

More than just flat bread, this focaccia is a great base for open-
faced sandwiches with sliced left over meat or poultry or cheese,
spread with robust mustard. Or try juicy tomatoes, thinly sliced with
fresh basil strewn over.

Basic Sponge

In processor fitted with metal blade, mix Basic Sponge with water,
salt, honey, olive oil and rosemary until smooth. Combine flours and
add to sponge mixture, 1/4 cup at a time, pulsing several times to
incorporate each addition. Then process dough until supple, elastic
and stick- ing slightly to work bowl, about 1 minute, adding more
water or flour by teaspoon, if dough is either too dry or too wet.
Dough should be very sticky, almost wet.

Transfer dough to large plastic bag, squeeze out all air and seal
tightly on top to allow room for dough to expand. Set bag in bowl and
let dough rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. Can be
refrigerated overnight once punched down.

Oil round pizza pans, preferably black steel. Sprinkle with corn meal.
Divide dough in half. Gently stretch each into about 12-inch diameter
round. Transfer to pans. Dimple dough with fingers.

Heat butter with garlic until melted. Brush over surface of each
focaccia, dividing evenly. Scatter sun-dried tomatoes on top. Season
to taste with salt and crushed hot red pepper. If baking 1 focaccia
at a time, refrigerate unbaked loaf until after first is baked.

Bake on lower rack of 425-degree oven until lightly browned on edge,
about 18 to 20 minutes. Cut into wedges. Serve warm. Makes 2
(13-inch- diameter) focaccia loaves, or 4 servings.

Roti (Flat Whole-Wheat Bread)

breads, digest

2 cup chappati flour
1  or
1 cup whole-wheat flour mixed w/
1 cup cake flour
1  additional flour for
1  dusting

Put the flour in a bowl.  Slowly add enough water so that you will be
able to gather the flour together and make a soft dough. You may need
about 2 1/2 tablespoons less than a cup of water. Knead the dough for
7 to 8 minutes or until it is smooth.  Make a ball and put it inside
a bowl. Cover the bowl with a damp dishcloth and set it aside for
half an hour.

If the dough looks very runny, flour your hands and knead for another
few minutes.  Form twelve equal balls and dust each with a little
flour. Keep them covered.

Set a cast-iron griddle or skillet to heat over a medium-low flame.
Allow at least 5 minutes for that. Keep about a cup of dusting flour
near you. Remove a ball of dough and flatten it between the palms of
your hands. Dust it on both sides with flour.  Roll it out, as thinly
and evenly as you can, aiming for a 5 1/2 inch round. When the
griddle is hot, slap the roti onto its heated surface.  Cook for
about a minute or until soft bubbles begin to form.  Turn the roti
over. Cook for half a minute on the second side.

If you have a gas fire, light a second burner on a medium flame and
put the roti directly on it.  Using tongs, rotate the roti so that
all areas are exposed to the shooting flames. Take 5 seconds to do
this. Turn the roti over and repeat for about 3 seconds. The roti
should puff up. Put the roti on a plate and cover with a towel. Make
all roti this way.

If you have an electric stove, place the griddle and roti under a
broiler for a few seconds, until the roti puffs up. Serve hot.

Roti Dough

breads

2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 single vegetable oil
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 single milk to mix

Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt into a bowl. Add
enough to form a stiff dough.  Knead the dough well on a lightly
floured board, form into 4 or more equal-sized balls. Roll out the
dough thinly to form 8-inch or 12-inch circles.  Then brush on a thin
coating of vegetable oil. Roll into balls again, cover, and allow to
stand for 15 minutes at room temperature.
Roll out the dough again and flatten to the original dimensions by
patting lightly.  Heat a cast-iron or heavy-bottomed frying pan so
that when tested with a drop of water, it sizzles. Place the rotis,
one at a time, in the pan and cook for a minute.  Turn, and spread a
thin layer of vegetable oil on the face of each roti, and turn
frequently until cooked- when brown flecks appear on the surface.
Remove from frying pan and pound between the palms of the until it
becomes supple. Keep rotis warm and moist by covering with a towel.
Yields: 4-6 servings Notes from cookbook: Traditionally rotis are
cooked on a flat iron grid called a tawa, but any heavy skillet or
griddle can be used. If the roti is to be filled with any curried
meat, poultry, or vegetable and eaten as a food, make 12-inch rotis.
Place the filling in the center and fold in the edges. When they are
to be served as a bread to dip up curries, chutney gravies, prepare
8-inch rotis.

      ----DOUGH----
5 cup flour
2 slice margarine
2 oz fresh yeast
3/4 cup sugar
3  eggs, beaten
2 cup milk or water
      ----FILLING----
1 cup sugar
1/3 cup cocoa
1  jam

On Fridays, you can smell the distinct aroma of Rugelach on every
street corner in Israel. People anxious to buy them for the weekend
will line up at their neighborhood bakery to get them hot out of the
oven. Unfortunately, due to their small size, there never seems to be
enough of these delicious pastries to go around.

Mix yeast with 1 tsp. sugar and 1/2 cup of lukewarm milk (or water),
until yeast starts bubbling. Mix in rest of ingredients and knead
until dough doesn't stick to pan. Cool in refrigerator for at least 2
hours.

Roll dough into a flat sheet. Spread jam on dough and spread sugar,
cocoa mixture on top. Cut into triangles and roll starting from the
base of the triangle. On a cookie sheet, bake at medium heat (375_ )
until golden (25-35 minutes). Makes approximately 40.

Ruisleipa (Sour Rye Bread)

breads, sourdough, finnish

1/2 cup sour bread starter
2 cup warm water of potato water
3 1/2 cup rye flour
1 pkg active dry yeast
2 teaspoon salt
3 1/2 cup sifted white flour

In large mixing bowl mix sour bread starter and 2 cups warm or potato
water.  Blend in 1 cup rye flour. Cover lightly and let stand in a
warm place for about 20 to 40 hours, depending on degree of sourness
desired.

Disolve yeast in 1/4 cup warm water, then stir into the soured
mixture. Add the salt and very gradually beat in the remaining rye
flour. Add the white flour a little at a time beating well after each
addition. When a stiff dough is formed, let it rest for 10 to 15
minutes. Turn onto floured board and knead until smooth. Place dough
into slightly greased bowl turning to grease the top.Cover and let
rise until doubled in bulk. Divide into two parts.  1/2 cup of the
dough may be reserved for your next baking. Keep reserved dough in
refridgerator in covered container.

To make Eastern-Finnish style loaves, shape each of the two pieces of
dough in to a ball and place on a lightly greased baking sheet. Cover
and let rise until almost doubled, about 30 minutes.

To make Western_Finnish style flat loaves, shape the dough into two
balls and flatten the by patting to about 1" thick, keeping the shape
round. With your fingers make a hole in the center about 2" in
diameter. dust the top lightly with rye flour.  Place the rolls on a
lightly greased baking sheet. Prick all over the top with a fork.
Cover and let rise until about double in bulk, abouth 30 minutes.

Bake in a 375 preheated oven for 45 minutes or until the loaves are
lightly browned.

Sour bread starter.

About 2 days before making sour rye bread mix 1/2 cup milk with 1/2
cup rye flour.  Milk must be at room temperature. Let stand uncovered
in a warm place until the mixture begins to bubble and has a
pleasantly sour odor. You may refridgerate at this point or use the
entire amount immediately in a bread dough.

Ruth Almans Sourdough Starter

breads

2 cup thick potato water
2 tablespoon sugar
2 cup flour (more or less)
1/2 teaspoon yeast (use yeast only to speed acti; on)

Dump above into Sourdough Pot.

Boil potatoes with jackets on until they fall to pieces.

Lift skins out, mash potatoes making a puree.  Cool. Add more water
to make sufficient liquid, if necessary. Richter the potatoe starter,
richer the starter.  Put all  ingredients  in pot. Beat until smooth
creamy batter. Cover. Set  aside  to start fermentation.

*My Note After the starter has had about 3 days to get going good,
put in refrigerator.   Take  out  what you need to make bread,
pancakes...put equal amount of flour and water in that you take
starter out. One teaspoon of this will  make  a  phenomenal amount of
starter...this is a KILLER sourdough.

Rye Beer Bread

breads

1 1/2 tablespoon active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water
2 cup dark beer, at room temp
2 tablespoon molasses or caramel
2 tablespoon lard or vegetable fat, melted
2 tablespoon crushed caraway seeds
1 tablespoon salt
3 cup rye flour
2 1/2 cup to 3 cups white flour, preferably u; nbleached

Makes 2 round loaves In a large bowl dissolve the yeast in the warm
water. Stir in the beer, molasses, lard, caraway seeds, salt, rye
flour, and enough white flour until the dough becomes difficult to
stir. Turn the dough out onto a floured working surface and let rest
while you clean out and grease your bowl.  Knead the dough, adding
more white flour as necessary; it will be very tacky, but up to 3
cups of white flour in all and about 8-10 minutes of kneading should
be enough. Return the dough to the greased bowl, cover with plastic
wrap, and let rise until double in volume - about 2 hours. Turn the
dough out, punch it down, and form into 2 rounds. Place far apart on
a greased baking sheet sprinkled with corn meal. Let rise covered
with a towel until double - about 45 minutes. If you have tiles or a
baking stone, heat the oven well ahead to 375 F to warm them, and to
get a good crust use a device to create steam. If you don't want to
bother with a steaming device, brush the loaves with cold water
before they go in the oven and again two or three times during the
first 10 minutes. If you have tiles or a baking stone, slip the
loaves directly onto the hot surface; otherwise simply bake the
loaves on the baking sheet. After 10 minutes reduce the heat to 350 F
and bake another 40 minutes. Cool on racks.

Rye Bread

breads

4 cup all-purpose flour
2 cup rye flour
2 pkg active dry yeast *
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon caraway seed
2 cup buttermilk
1/3 cup light molasses
1 single butter or margarine

1. In medium bowl, combine all-purpose flour and rye flour. In large
bowl, combine 2 cups flour mixture, yeast, salt, and caraway seed.
In 2-quart saucepan, over low heat, heat buttermilk, molasses and
1/3 cup butter or margarine until very warm (120 - 130 F). (Butter
or margarine does not need to melt, and mixture will appear
curdled.)

2. With mixer at low speed, gradually beat liquid into dry
ingredients. Increase speed to medium, beat mixture 2 minutes,
occasionally scraping bowl with rubber spatula.

3. Gradually beat in 1/2 cup of flour mixture or enough to make a
thick batter; continue beating 2 minutes occasionally scraping
bowl with rubber spatula. With spoon, stir in enough additional
flour mixture (about 2 1/2 cups) to make a soft dough.

4. Turn dough onto well-floured surface and knead until smooth and
elastic, about 10 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball and place
it in a greased large bowl, turning dough over to grease top.
Cover with towel; let rise in warm place (80 to 85 F), away from
draft, until doubled, about 1 hour. (Dough is doubled when two
fingers pressed lightly into dough leave a dent.)

5. Punch down dough by pushing down the center with fist, then
pushing edges of dough into center. Turn dough onto lightly
floured surface; cut dough in half; cover with bowl and let rest
for 15 minutes.

6. Grease large cookie sheet. Shape each dough half into a smooth
round ball by pulling the sides of the dough underneath; place
balls of dough on cookie sheet and flatten slightly; Cover with
towel; let rise in warm place away from draft, until dough has
doubled, about 1 hour.

7. Preheat oven to 350 F. Brush loaves with 2 tablespoons melted
butter or margarine. Bake loaves 35 minutes or until loaves sound
hollow when lightly tapped with fingers. Remove loaves from cookie
sheet immediately so the bottoms don't become soggy and leave them
to cool completely on wire racks away from draft.

Rye Sourdough Starter

breads, sourdough, jewish

1 pkg dry yeast
3 cup water, tepid (80-degree)
3 1/2 cup flour, rye medium
1  onion, small, peeled and
1  halved.

The 4-cup batch of starter made by this recipe is enough to bake any
of the rye breads requiring a rye starter, with enough left over to
serve as the nucleus for another baking. When you "feed" leftover
starter... which should be done every 2 weeks or so.. add a little
rye flour and water, using 3 parts of flour to 2 of water. To build
up a small amount of starter to a quantity large enough for baking,
do the job in several steps, never adding a larger measure of flour
than the amount of starter on hand. Let the starter stand at room
temperature overnight or for up to 24 hours, until it is bubbly and
no longer smells floury. To increase further, add more flour and
water in the same proportions and again let the starter ferment until
it is bubbly enough to use.  Store leftover starter in the
refrigerator between bakings and "feedings," and for indefinite
storage, freeze it. Thaw, then feed the starter and let it ferment at
room temperature before use.  Makes about 4 cups.

1. Dissolve the yeast in 2 cups of the tepid water, then beat in 2
cups of the rye flour, beating until no lumps remain. Add the onion,
cover loosely with a cloth, and let stand at room temperature for 24
hours. 2. Remove the onion.  Beat in 1 cup tepid water, then 1 1/2
cups rye flour. Cover with the cloth and let stand for 24 hours
longer. The starter should now be pleasantly sour-smelling, almost
beery, and bubbly. (Depending upon the temperature of the room, a
slightly longer or shorter period of fermentation may produce this
result.) TO USE: The starter is now ready for use and can be
refrigerated for up to 24 hours before use, without further feeding.
If you must hold the starter longer before use, the night before it
is wanted, add 1/2 cup tepid water and 3/4 cup rye flour and let is
stand at room temperature overnight.

Rye Yeast Bread

breads

1/3 cup water
1 cup white grape juice
1 pkg quick-rise yeast (1 tb)
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon oil
4 cup rye flour plus up to 1/2 cup

Warm the water and grape juice to about 115 F and stir in the yeast.
Let the mixture stand for about 10 minutes or until it is foamy. Stir
in the salt, oil, and 2 cups of the flour, and beat it with a spoon
or mixer until it is smooth.

Add enough of the rest of the flour to make a soft dough. Knead the
dough on a floured board for 10 minutes. Place the dough in an oiled
bowl, turn it over so the top of the ball is also oiled, and cover it
with a towel. Let it rise in a warm (85 to 90 F) place for about 45
minutes, or until it is doubled in volume.

Shape the dough into a loaf, place it in an oiled 8 x 4 inch loaf
pan, and let it rise in a warm place again for about 30 minutes, or
until it doubles in volume. Bake at 425 F for 10 minutes, then lower
the oven temperature to 350 F for an additional 35 to 45 minutes of
baking. Remove it from the oven when the loaf is brown and has pulled
away from the sides of the pan slightly.  Makes one loaf.

2 teaspoon salt
1 pkg dry quick-rising yeast
3  eggs
4 cup flour

Makes 2 loaves

Scald the milk, or bring it almost to a simmer, and add the butter,
sugar, and salt.  Let cool until tepid or just warm. Dissolve the
yeast in 1/4 cup of tepid water. Using your electric mixer, if you
have a powerful one, beat the eggs and then add teh milk mixture, the
yeast water, and finally the flour. Beat until very smooth, about 5
minutes.

Leave the dough in the mixing bowl and allow it to rise for one half
hour. Beat it down with the mixer just for a moment and then allow it
to rise again.  Do this a total of 3 times and then put the dough in
2 large greased bread pans.  Allow to rise to double in bulk and then
bake in a preheated 375 F oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour.; The bread
should be light and have a nice crust.

Saltines & Family

breads

3 tablespoon shortening
2 tablespoon butter
1  about 3 1/2 c unbleached flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon sugar
1  egg white, beaten to a loose froth
1 cup whole milk

Makes about 11 dozen 2" saltines From "Make Your Own Groceries" by
Daphne Metaxas Hartwig.

Use this dough to make a whole range of crackers - saltines; oyster
crackers; and big, round sea toast crackers.

kosher, sea, or table salt

Melt the shortening and butter together; let cool. Sift 1 3/4 c of the
flour into a lg mixing bowl along with the baking powder, salt, and
sugar; make a well in the center and pour in the shortening and
butter; stir to combine, then stir in the egg white.  Add the milk
and beat vigorously to smooth out some of the lumps, then gradually
sift in enough flour to make a dough that will be stiff enough to
roll out. Form the dough into a ball; knead it for 10 min on a
floured surface until it is smooth and satiny. Divide the dough into
2 equal balls, wrap each in wax paper and let them rest at room
temperature for 20 - 30 min.

On a floured surface, roll the first dough ball out as thinly as you
possibly can.  Cut the dough into 2" squares using a pizza cutter, a
ravioli wheel, or a very sharp, greased knife; save the scraps. Place
the dough squares just slightly apart from each other on ungreased
cookie sheet.  Sprinkle the squares with salt to taste and pat them
to embed the salt.  Prick each square several times with a fork. Bake
in a preheated 375 F oven for 15 to 20 min until just slightly
browned. Repeat for remaining dough ball and scraps.

SEA TOAST

After the dough has rested, pinch off pieces about 1 1/2 to 2" round.
On a floured surface, roll each piece into the thinnest free-form
circle possible.  Place the circles on an ungreased cookie sheet;
prick with a fork and bake at 375 F for about 15 min.  Very crispy
and perfect for cheese or soups.  Makes about 2 dozen.

OYSTER CRACKERS

One rested dough ball at a time, roll the dough out as thinly as
possible; transfer to a cookie sheet.  Cut the dough into diamond
shaped, 1" crackers with a ravioli wheel or a pizza cutter; there is
no need to separate the crackers as the dough's elasticity will do
the job. Salt, embedded and gently prick the diamonds as previously
described. Bake as directed for about 10 min.

Salvation Army Doughnuts

breads, desserts, breakfast

2 tablespoon vegetable shortening
1 cup sugar
2  beaten eggs
4 3/4 cup flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla powder or vanilla extract.

Cream shortening and sugar until fluffy.  Add eggs and vanilla if
using extract and beat well. Combine dry ingredients (including
vanilla if using powder) then sift together. Add dry mixture to
creamed mixture, alternating with milk. Roll dough 1/2 inch thick on
floured board. Cut into rounds, and cut out centers. A glass works
well for cutting, with a small, empty prescription pill bottle to cut
the centers. The centers can be rolled together for more doughnuts or
fried as they are for 'donut holes.' Deep fry in vegetable oil,
turning once, until browned. Drain on grocery bag (to absorb oil) and
dust with confectioner's sugar. Yield: depends on how thin you roll,
and what you do with the centers.

San Francisco-Style French Bread

breads, sourdough

1 1/2 cup warm water
1 pkg active dry yeast
1 cup sourdough starter
2 teaspoon sugar
2 teaspoon salt
5 cup all-purpose flour (or 6)
1  water for tops of loaves

Warm a large bowl.  Pour 1 1/2 cups warm water into warmed bowl.
Sprinkle yeast over water.  Set aside to soften 5 minutes. Stir in
sourdough starter, sugar and salt. Beat in 3 cups flour until
blended. Cover with a cloth and set in a warm place free from drafts.
Let rise 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until doubled in size. Lightly grease a
large baking sheet; set aside. Stir down dough. Stir in enough
remaining flour to make a medium stiff dough.  Turn out onto a
lightly floured surface. Knead dough 8 to 10 minutes or until smooth
and elastic. Add more flour if necessary. Shape kneaded dough into
two 10x3 1/2" loaves. Pull out ends of each to make them narrower
than center of loaf. Or shape into 2 round loaves. Place on prepared
baking sheet. Cover with a cloth and set in a warm place free from
drafts.  Let rise 1 to 2 hours or until almost doubled in size.
Preheat oven to 400F.  Pour water 1" deep into a 12x 71/2" baking
pan. Place in bottom of preheating oven. Use a pastry brush to brush
tops of loaves with water.  Use a very sharp knife to cut diagonal
slashes across tops of loaves.  Bake in preheated oven 45 minutes or
until crust is golden brown and loaves sound hollow when tapped with
your fingers. After 30 minutes, if loaves are golden brown, cover
with a tent of foil to prevent further browning. Remove from baking
sheet. Cool on a rack. Makes 2 loaves.

Saturday Market Elephant Ears

breads

1 pkg dry yeast
1 cup warm water
2  eggs beaten
4 cup flour
6 tablespoon sugar

Servings: 12

Sugar and cinnamon mix - set aside

Soften yeast in warm water.  Combine all ingredients except the
cinnamon sugar  mix.  Mix well.  Divide dough into 12 pieces. Let sit
10 minutes. Roll out on a lightly floured board. Using hands, stretch
each piece into circular shape. Heat vegetable oil in 10 skillet
(cast iron is best). Place each circle of dough in the hot grease.
Turn once - the surface will bubble and blister and should be lightly
browned. Turn with spatula and broad knife.  Place on absorbent paper
toweling. Sprinkle immediately with mix of sugar and cinnamon. If you
tear a hole in the circle as it is being stretched that will not
matter.

This will be a favorite for all ages.  The recipe has been around a
long time, but each time we make them someone has never heard of
individuals making them.

Sauteed Greens For Piadini

breads, italian

1 lb fresh spinach or swiss chard
1/2 lb broccoli top (cime di rapa) or othe; r bitter greens
1 lb head savoy cabbage
1  salt
1/4 cup olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1  freshly ground pepper

Wash spinach and cime di rapa thoroughly.  Discard the darkest outer
leaves of the cabbage and cut off the stem; cut cabbage in quarters.

Bring 3 or 4 quarts of water to a boil, add 1 tablespoon salt and put
in the cime di rapa.  Cover loosely top and cook for 8 to 12 minutes.
Drain and set aside.

If using chard, cook in exactly the same manner, stalks included, but
in its own water.  The cabbage is cooked the same way, but without
salt, for 15 to 20 minutes. If using spinach, cook in a covered pan
with just the water that clings to the leaves, adding salt to taste.
Cook until tender, drain, set aside.

Gently but firmly squeeze all the moisture you can out of all the
greens. Chop together, but not too fine.

Put oil and garlic in medium saute pan and saute over medium heat
until garlic becomes lightly colored.  Add chopped greens, turning
with a fork so they are evenly coated, seasoning with salt and
pepper. Saute about 10 minutes, turning frequently.  Taste and
correct seasoning.

Serve hot.

Serves 6.

Savory Bread Sticks

breads, quick bread

1  mary bowles dnsr31a
1 large pkg day-old hot dog buns
1 cup butter; melted
2 tablespoon italian seasonings
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper or to taste

Slice hot dog buns into fourths lengthwise.  Dip bread in melted
butter and arrange on a large baking sheet. Mix spices and sprinkle
over bread sticks. Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes or until
crunchy, but not brown. Serve hot or cold.  Let cool well before
covering. Stores well in air-tight containers. This was invented by a
friend to use up left-over buns from a weiner roast, but it is too
delicious to wait for left-overs. It is great with stew, spaghetti,
or by themselves for snacks!

surface. Knead until smooth and elastic (about 7 minutes); add enough
remaining flour to prevent dough from sticking to hands. Place dough
in a bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to coat top. Cover and
let rise in a warm place (85-degrees), free from drafts, 1 hour, or
until doubled in bulk. Punch dough down, and divide into 4 equal
portions, shaping each portion into a ball (cover the remaining dough
while working to prevent it from drying out). Roll 1 ball into a 15 x
12-inch paper-thin rectangle on a baking sheet coated with cooking
spray. Score the dough by making 2 lengthwise cuts and 5 crosswise
cuts to form 18 crackers.  Prick entire surface liberally with a fork
(do not allow to rise). Bake at 300-degrees for 23 minutes or until
lightly browned. Remove from pan; let cool completely on a wire rack.
Separate into individual crackers.  Repeat

procedure with remaining dough.  Store in an airtight container.

Savory Scones

breads

2 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
4 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup unsalted butter cut into
1  16 pieces
1 cup buttermilk

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 2. Combine flour, baking powder, salt
and baking soda in food processor. Pulse once or twice to combine.
Add butter. Pulse 10 to 12 times or until mixture resembles fresh
bread crumbs. (You can use pastry blender to cut butter into flour if
you don't have a food processor.) 3. Transfer mixture to large bowl.
Add 1 cup buttermilk, stirring quickly to combine. If mixture is too
dry, add more buttermilk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until dough holds
together and is slightly stringy and crumbly. Turn out onto lightly
floured surface. Knead 6 to 7 times (do not knead more than that or
scones will become tough). 4. Divide dough in half. With floured
hands, press each half into 9x4-inch rectangle. With short side
facing you, fold into thirds like a business letter. Press each
portion into 6 to 7-inch circle; place on ungreased baking sheet. Cut
each circle into 6 equal wedges; pull wedges slightly apart. Brush
tops with remaining buttermilk. Let stand 10 minutes. 5. Bake in 400
degree oven for 20 minutes, or until tops are lightly browned. Remove
and serve warm.

Ham and Sage Scones: Add 4 ounces cubed boiled ham and 1 teaspoon
dried sage with butter. Pulse 10 to 12 times until ham pieces are no
larger than grains of rice. Instead of pressing dough into circles,
press each half into 7 1/2-inch square. Cut each into 8 squares.

Cheddar Cheese Scones: Add 4 ounces cubed Cheddar and 1/4 to 1/2
teaspoon cayenne pepper along with butter. Process 10 to 12 times
until cheese pieces are no larger than dried peas. After brushing
tops with buttermilk, sprinkle with sesame seeds, using about 2
teaspoons total.

Rosemary and Black Olive Scones: After dividing dough in half,
scatter 1/2 teaspoon crumbled dried rosemary and 1/4 cup chopped
kalamata olives (about 10 olives) over each batch of dough before it
is folded into thirds.

Yield: 12 scones

Scallion Cakes

breads, vegetables, chinese

1 lb all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon sugar
2 teaspoon coarse-grain sea salt or- kosher sa; lt
5  scallions; coarsely chopped
5 tablespoon vegetable oil (or more)

Place the flour in a mixing bowl.  Sprinkle evenly with the baking
powder and sugar.  Mix with a wooden spoon. Add the water gradually,
stirring and mixing with the wooden spoon. Knead the dough for 3-4
minutes. Cover it with a damp cloth and leave for half an hour, then
knead again for 2-3 minutes.  Divide the dough into ten portions and
form into narrow strips 8-10 inches long.  Flatten the strips with a
rolling pin and ten bands of pancake thickness.  Sprinkle each band
with salt and then with chopped scallions.  Roll the bands lengthwise
into long double-thickness spaghetti-shaped strips.  Hold one end of
the strip and turn the other end around in circles until the
concentric rings form themselves around the center into a spiral
pancake. Flatten the pancake with the palm of the hand.  Repeat until
the dough has been made into ten spiral pancakes.

Heat the oil on the bottom of a large flat-bottomed frying pan. When
hot, lift the handle of the frying pan so that the surface of the pan
is evenly greased. Place the spiral pancakes on the surface of the
pan. Fry over low heat for 2-1/2 to 3 minutes and turn the pancakes
over. Repeat and fry gently until the pancakes are evenly browned on
both sides.

Scallion Pancakes

breads, chinese

1 cup flour
1/3 cup water, boiling hot
2 tablespoon scallion greens, minced
2 teaspoon lard or crisco
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoon oil

Mix flour and water. Add a little more flour or a little cold water if
dough is not the right consistency. Knead until smooth. Let rest 15
min. Roll dough into a cylinder and divide into 6 pieces.

Flatten each piece into a 4" circle. Brush with softened fat and
sprinkle with salt and scallions. Roll each pancake into a long thin
spiral and flatten it. Fold this spiral into a square and flatten
again. Roll into a short fat spiral and flatten this to a 4" circle.

Heat 3 T oil and fry each piece until golden (flip once to cook both
sides). Add a teaspoon of oil or so between pancakes if the oil is too
depleted.

Adapted from Wei-Chuan, Chinese Snacks, to the way I do it; but I do
less flattening and rolling.

Scones

breads

2 cup flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon sugar
1 cup milk
1/8 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 tablespoon shortening
1/2 cup currants

Sift flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Cut in shortening with
fingers. Add currants and soda to mix and stir into flour mixture
with a fork. Turn out onto a floured board. Knead slightly and pat or
roll into 1/2" thickness. Cut into triangles or circles. Bake these
on an ungreased griddle over medium heat. As one side becomes brown,
turn and brown the other side, then turn each scone slightly on edge
and place on side of griddle to the "fire". Turn until all edges are
slightly browned. The firing will cook the scones through from all
sides so there will be no raw dough in the center. Split and serve
with butter, or fill with such as ham or cream cheese.

Scotch Pancakes

breads, breakfast, ethnic

1/4 lb plain white household flour
1 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
1 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartare
1 oz caster sugar
1  egg
1/4 pint milk or cream

Sift the flour with the raising agents and stir in the sugar. Make a
well in the centre and break the egg into it. Whisk the milk into the
egg, then gradually incorporate the dry ingredients to make a very
smooth, thick batter.  Alternately, simply mix everything together in
a food processor. If time permits let the batter stand for 30 minutes
before cooking.
Heat a griddle, bakestone or cast-iron frying pan until very hot
~ or cook direct on the hot plate of an Aga. Grease your chosen
surface lightly with buttered paper, using just enough fat to prevent
the pancakes from sticking.  Using a large metal spoon held point
downward, drop a few small rounds of batter on to the hot surface.
Space them well apart. Cook over steady heat until bubbles rise to
the surface and the underside of the pancakes are browned - about 2
minutes. Loosen them gently with a palette knife, then flip them over
and cook for about 1 minute longer. Makes about 16 pancakes. Source:

Semolina Bread With Black Sesame Seeds

breads

1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 7/8 cup water -- 105-115 degrees
1 1/4 cup basic bread sponge
3 1/2 cup durum wheat flour
1/3 cup durum wheat flour -- for
1  kneading
1/3 cup yellow cornmeal
1/4 cup black sesame seeds
4 teaspoon kosher salt
1  cornmeal -- for sprinkling

Black sesame seeds may be available at health food stores or Japanese
markets.

In a bowl, dissolve  the yeast in the water.  Allow to proof for three
minutes.

Stir the sponge into the water, breaking the sponge up using your
hands or a spoon.

Add 3 1/2 cups of the durum flour, cornmeal, 2 tablespoons of sesame
seeds, and the salt and mix, scraping and folding until the dough
gathers into a single mass.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly
floured surface, and knead the dough until smooth and elastic,
gradually adding as much of the 1/3 cup of durum aas needed (but as
little as you can get away with).

Shape into a ball and place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover
with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

After removing the dough from the refrigerator, allow to sit for two
hours in a draft-free location.

Sprinkle a baking sheet, without sides, generously with cornmeal.
Flour a worksurface.  Halve the dough and flatten each half gently
into a 10x12 inch rectangle. Roll each rectangle tightly along a 10
inch side, making two 12 inch cylinders.  Roll from the center
towards the edge to make 20 inch ropes. Coil the rope from one end,
pulling up the center knot. Place the coils on the baking sheet.

Mist the loaves lightly using a plant sprayer.  Spoon a tablespoon of
the seeds along each of the coils. Cover with plastic wrap and allow
to double in a draft-free location. This should take 1 to 2 hours.

Preheat the oven for at least thirty minutes along with a baking
stone or tiles on the middle rack to 425. Place a baking pan with
decent sides on the bottom shelf. Boil two cups of water. Pour the
boiling water into the baking pan.   With a quick jerk, slide the
loaves off the sheet and onto the stone.

Bake for 25 minutes until the loaves are hollow sounding when tapped
on the bottom.  When done, cool on a rack.

Note:  Durum wheat is the hardest variety of wheat and makes a very
high-gluten flour.  Durum is made from the same wheat as semolina,
but is finely ground and is superior for making bread. It can be
found in health food stores, specialty food markets, and some Italian
markets.

3. Punch down; knead several times.  Divide into 12 equal pieces.
Roll each into a 12 inch rope, covering pieces with towel while
working.

4.  Bring ends of dough together, overlapping by about 1 inch and
stretching overlap around other end to meet underneath. Pinch firmly
to seal.  NOTE: Unless ends are pinched together very firmly, they
will come apart in the water.

5.  Poaching liquid.  In a wide saucepan, bring water to a boil; add
sugar. Slip bagels into water, 3-4 at a time; cook over medium heat
for 1 minute. Using slotted spoon or spatula, remove bagels to well

1 1/2 cup boiling water
1 cup rolled oats, quick or old-fashioned
1/2 cup sesame seeds
1 pkg active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (105-115'f.)
1/2 cup tightly packed dark brown sugar
1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
4 1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon

In large mixing bowl, combine boiling water and rolled oats. Place
sesame seeds in small fry pan. Toast over medium heat, stirring

mixture.

In mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water; add brown sugar, and let
stand 5 minutes until yeast bubbles. Stir in the butter, salt and
cooled oat mixture. Add whole wheat flour and beat in the all-purpose
flour until mixture makes a stiff dough. Let rest 15 minutes.

Settin' 'round Bread

breads

1/4 cup water (at 105 degrees)
1/3 cup turbinado sugar (most any sugar wil; l do, though)
2 pkg yeast (dry), active
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup shortening
1 1/2 cup water
1/2 cup milk
1 large egg
1 cup dry milk, non-fat
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon honey
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon, ground
1/2 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup cornmeal
1/4 cup bran
1/4 cup cracked wheat
1/4 cup buckwheat
1/2 cup soy flour
1 cup rye flour
2 1/2 cup whole wheat flour
3 cup white flour
1  butter

Melt the shortening and the butter.  Let them cool a bit, so as not to kill
the yeast when they are added to the dough.  If you want to scald the milk,
do so, and also let it cool (it is common practice to scald milk before
baking with it, though I never do.)

Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the 1/4 cup of lukewarm water.

Mix the cinnamon, oats, corn meal, bran, cracked wheat, buckwheat, soy
flour and rye flour. Add the rest of the water, the milk, butter,
shortening, egg and honey, and mix well. Stir in the dissolved yeast
mixture.  Mix in the salt and the whole wheat flour.

Stir in the white flour, about 1/2 cup at a time, until the mixture is
stiff enough to knead. You'll probably have about half of it left.

Remove the dough from the mixing bowl, onto a floured surface.  Knead the
dough, adding more white flour as necessary to keep the dough workable.
Knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, about ten minutes. It's
okay if you end up using less than or more than the three cups of white
flour; just use whatever it takes.

Put the dough back into a bowl that's been very lightly greased.  Let it
rise, covered, in a still, warm place (around 85 degrees F. is best, though
room temperature will work) for 45 minutes, or until it has doubled in
bulk.

Punch the dough down, divide in half, shape into loaves and place each half
into a loaf pan which has been very lightly greased.  Let rise again, for
another 45 minutes, in a still, warm place, until the loaves have about
doubled in bulk.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. as the bread finishes rising. Bake the
bread for 35-40 minutes, until it sounds hollow when tapped. Remove from
the loaf pans and rub the top of the loaves with some butter to give them a
nice, soft, chewy crust.

NOTES:

*  A 7-grain bread for toasting or eating plain -- This bread was first
made from whatever was settin' 'round the kitchen when I started baking. It
has a wonderful texture and flavor. Yield: 2 large loaves.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  about 3 hours (half of it rising time).
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

2 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon heavy cream
3/4 cup butter

knives or working with your fingertips, until the mixture looks like
fresh crumbs. Add the buttermilk, currants, and orange rind. Mix only
until the dry ingredients are moistened.

Gather the dough into a ball and press so it holds together. Turn the
dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead lightly twelve times.
Divide the dough in two and pat each half into a circle 1/2 to 3/4
inch thick.

In a small bowl combine the cream, cinnamon, and remaining 2 tb sugar,
stirring to blend. Brush the dough with this glaze.

Cut each circle into eight scone shape pieces (circular, or wedge).

Simit  (Turkish Croissant With Sesame Seeds)

breads, turkish

8 oz flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 oz margarine
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon milk, plus extra
1 tablespoon water
1  egg
1  sesame seeds

Put the flour and salt in a large bowl and make a hole in the middle.
Into this hole pour the melted marg, olive oil, milk, water and
beaten egg.

Stirring from the outside into the middle gradually mix all the
liquids into the flour until you have a dough. It will feel a bit
oily, but is quite manageable. With floured hands shape the dough
into rings about the diameter of a saucer and arrange them on a
baking sheet. Brush them over with milk and sprinkle the sesame seeds
on them. Bake them in a 400 degree oven for approx. 30 min. or until
they are nicely browned.

Simple Orange Muffins

breads, vegetarian

1 large orange
1 oz tofu
3/4 cup sugar; (less if desired)
3 tablespoon oil
1/2 cup water or orange juice
2 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/4 teaspoon salt

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Finely grate the zest from the orange.  Squeeze out and strain the
orange's juice.  Set zest and juice aside.

In a bowl, thoroughly mash the tofu with the sugar, or blend together
with an electric mixer.  Mix in the finely grated orange zest and
juice from the orange, oil, and water (or additional orange juice).

In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, cream of
tartar and salt.  Blend in the orange juice mixture. Spoon batter
into muffin pans, filling each cup about 2/3 full. Bake for about 15
minutes, or until muffins are starting to brown very lightly, and
toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.

Karen's notes:  I always use tofu as an egg-replacer in baked goods,
with excellent results.  It may only be luck, or coincidence, so if
you don't have a piece of tofu handy, try omitting it.

These muffins are pretty sweet, so you may want to decrease the
amount of sugar used.  The sugar does seem to act as a humectant
though, so the muffins will stay a little moister in storage if you
use more sugar.

Sliced Tomato/Mozzarella/Garlic Bread Appetizer

appetizers, breads, vegetables

      ----FROM LINDA FIELDS AT----
      ----CYBEREALM BBS 3157861120----
1  tomatoes, diced
1  red onion, diced
1  light mozarella cheese,
1  .sliced or shredded
1  frozen prepared garlic bread
1  vinagrette dressing
      ----VINAGRETTE DRESSING RECIPE----
1 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 cup balsamic vinegar
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoon fresh dill or 1 t dried dill
1 teaspoon minced garlic

Prepare the frozen garlic bread according to the directions.

On a slice of the bread, place a slice of the mozzarella cheese, or 1
Tablespoon of shredded cheese.  Add a thin slice of red onion ( or 1 T
diced onion) and a slice of tomato (or 1 T diced tomato). Drizzle the
Vinagrette dressing over all and enjoy!

For the dressing, put all ingredients into a small bowl or a jar and
shake vigorously.  Makes 2 cups of dressing which will keep in the
frige for 2 or 3 weeks.

What I did that was very good was drizzle the vinagrette over the
bread first, then add the onion and tomato and top with a little
grated Romano cheese.

Slo Rise Pita

breads

1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 1/2 cup warm water
3 cup whole wheat flour
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoon olive oil
3 cup unbleached all purpose flour

:       In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in water. One cup at a time,
stir in whole-wheat flour. Stir the dough 100 times in the same
direction. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 45 minutes.
:       Sprinkle salt over the dough and stir in oil. One cup at a
time, stir in white flour until the dough will take no more and
cannot be stirred. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work
surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer
the dough to a large, lightly oiled bowl, turn to coat and cover with
plastic wrap,. Let rise until doubled in volume approximately 3
hours. Gently punch down. (The dough can be stored, enclosed in a
plastic bag, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.)
:       Set a baking stone, unglazed quarry tiles or a lightly oiled
baking sheet on the bottom oven rack and pre-heat oven to 450 degrees
F.
:       Divide the dough into 16 equal pieces. Roll out each piece of
dough into a 7-to 8-inch circle that is 1/4 inch thick. Using your
hands or a semolina-dusted pizza peel, carefully transfer the
prepared dough to the heated baking surface. Bake for 2 to 3 minutes,
or until the breads have puffed. (Do not worry if all the breads do
not puff completely; they will still taste delicious.) When baked,
keep breads warm by stacking them and wrapping them in a clean
kitchen towel.

Slovak Loska (Langoshe) (Pagach?)

breads, ethnic

3 cup potatoes,mashed,cool,salted
1/2 cup flour

Blend flour into mashed potatoes. Add more flour if needed, but not to
much. Dough should not be sticky or crumbly. Divide dough into four
portions and roll out each portiom on floured board to 1/8 inch
thickness in 8 inch circles. Pick surface with a fork to prevent
puffing. Bake in preheated oven at 400 degrees. Bake on bottom
surface of oven, (I use cookie sheets) for about 7 minutes on each
side. After the Loska is baked, brush each side with either plain or
browned butter. Stack on a plate and cut into wedges. Loska is good
with any meatless soup.
As a child, I remember my Grandmother calling this Pagach.

Sm Muffins Or Biscuits

breads

9 cup flour; sifted
1/3 cup baking powder; double acting
1 cup nonfat dry milk plus
2 tablespoon nonfat dry milk
4 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cup vegetable shortening

Stir baking powder, dry milk and salt into the sifted flour. Sift all
dry ingredients together until well mixed. Cut or mix fat into flour
mixture utnil all particles are thouroughly coated and mixture
esembels coarse cornmeal. Sotre mix in a jar or can with a tight lid.
It can be measured into 2 cup amounts and put in plastic bags or
jarsd where it will be ready for use. It may be stored at room
temperature for 6 weeks. Vary the liquids: dry milk solids are
already in the mix so more milk is not need. You can use fruit juice,
water or meat broth for the liquid called for in a recipe.

The recipes in this Pick-A-pocket book were writted for commercial
packaged baking mix which has no milk so it is the liquid called for
in recipes. This mix is a perfect substitte. Just use water where it
calls for milk. (written out of my cookbook)

Basic biscuits: 2 cups mix, 1/2 cup water. Add water to mix and stir
20-25 times. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead 10-15
times. Roll to 1/2" thickness and cut with a knife to pockets shapes
or use biscuit cutter to make circles. Place in preheated sm and bake
5 minutes or until golden brown.

Sausage biscuits: 2 1/4 cups packaged biscuit baking mix(milk), 8
links sausages cooked.

Prepare biscuits according to package directions for rolled biscuits.
Knead dough, roll out on floured surface and cut 8 circles with a
biscuit cutter. Lay one sausage in center of each and wrap dough
around, pinching to seal. Sausages will stick out the ends. Bake 5
minutes or until golden brown.

Jelly biscuits: flatten unbaked biscuits with heel of your hand.
Place 1/2 teaspoon jelly or preserves in center. Fold over and pinch
edges together to seal. Bake 5 minutes or till golden.

Pimento cheese bread: 2 cups packaged biscuit baking mix, 1 egg,

Smoked Salmon & Brie Pizza

breads, main dish

1  pie: (makes 2 pies)
4 1/4 cup flour
1 1/2 cup water, lukewarm (105 to 115
1  degrees fahrenheit)
1 pkg active dry yeast
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoon olive oil
1  topping: (for one pie)
1 lb brie, rind discarded, cut
1  into small pieces
12 oz smoked salmon, cut into
1  small pieces
1 small onion, red, very thinly
1  sliced, separated into rings
1/4 cup olive oil, extra virgin

Put flour into a large bowl and make a deep well in the middle. Pour
warm water into the well, mix in the yeast, using a bit of flour in
the mix. Add the sugar, salt, and flour to the well, let stand for 10
minutes until mixture bubbles. Slowly stir all of the flour into the
yeast mixture. When it gets too thick to handle place it on a board
and knead it until elastic. Form a ball, place into a greased bowl,
then turn it over so the top of the ball is greased. Cover with a
towel and let rise in a warm and draft free place for an hour or
until double in bulk. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Punch down dough
and divide in half. Refrigerate one half for later. (Allow extra time
to rise). Roll the other half into a circle about 15 inches across.
Place on a 14 inch greased pizza pan, roll edges to form a rim.

Transfer the pie a pizza pan. Bake the pizza until the crust begins to
brown, about 6 minutes. Remove from oven and cover with cheese,
leaving 1/2 inch border around the edges. Arrange the salmon and
onion on top and drizzle evenly with olive oil. Return to the oven
and bake until the crust is golden brown and puffy, the cheese begins
to melt and the salmon is heated thru, about 4 minutes. Remove from
oven to a cutting tray or board and lightly brush the crust with
olive oil. Garnish with dill. Slice and serve immediately.

of your hands until pieces of butter are no longer visible.

Add  buttermilk  to a bowl and stir with a  wooden spoon until mixture
forms  a dough.   Sprinkle about 1/4 cup of remaining flour on a
board. Turn out dough and knead lightly for about 1 minute, working
in the flour from the board and forming  dough into a smooth, round
loaf about 8 inches in diameter.

Put loaf,  smooth side up,  in prepared pan and cut a deep cross in
it, slicing three-fourths of the way through the dough. Bake 55-60
minutes, or until loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Cool
on a wire rack.

Soda Bread (Irish Whisky Soda)

breads

      ----BREAD----
4 cup flour, all purpose
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 cup butter, chilled
1 cup raisins or currants (option)
1/2 cup honey, liquid
1/4 cup irish whisky or buttermilk
      ----GLAZE----
2 teaspoon irish whisky
2  ilk

BREAD:  In large bowl, combine flour, salt and baking soda.  With
pastry blender or two knives, cut in butter until mixture resembles
coarse crumbs.  Stir in raisins or currants (if using).  In separate
bowl, combine buttermilk, honey and whisky.  Add all at once to dry
ingredients; stir just until no dry spots remain.  Turn dough out onto
lightly floured surface.  Knead lightly 1 minute (too much handling
will toughen loaves, while too little will inhibit rising.)  Divide
dough in half and shape each half into an 8 in (20 cm) round.  Place
in two greased 8 in (1.2 L) round cake pans.  With floured knife, cut
a cross 1/2 in deep in each loaf.
GLAZE:  In small bowl, combine whisky and milk.  Brush loaves with
glaze.
Bake in 350F (180C) oven 35 to 40 minutes or until loaves sound
hollow when tapped on bottoms.  Remove from pans; let cool on wire
racks.  Cut into wedges.

Soda Crackers [america 1941]

breads, quick bread

      ----AMERICAN MEASUREMENTS----
4 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup sour milk
1 cup butter

From 1941, Soda Crackers Without Yeast. Because this is an old
recipe, it's hard to determine how many crackers it makes. The yield
will depend on how big you cut the squares. Preheat oven to 400
degrees F. Sift flour, soda and salt together and cut in the butter.
Add milk. The dough should be quite stiff.  Work it thoroughly for 10
minutes. Roll out on a floured board to about 1/4-inch in thickness
and cut in squares. Punch holes with fork. Place on greased pan and
bake until golden, about 8 to 10 minutes.

NOTE: To make sour milk, place 1 tablespoon vinegar in a cup, add
milk to three fourth cup.

Yield: 50 crackers

Soda Pretzels

breads, soda

:  dipping solution

5 c  Water
1/3 c  Baking soda
:          Dough-------------
1 1/2 c  white flour
1 1/2 c  whole wheat flour
1 ts Baking soda
4 tb Honey
1 c  Buttermilk
:          Course/Kosher salt

This recipe for pretzels uses traditional Irish soda bread dought
instead of a yeast based dough. It's quick and works great! The
pretzels come out excellent--like the street vendor type.  I hope you
enjoy...

Combine water and soda in a non-aluminum pot (Corning works well).
Heat to a boil or until all soda dissolves. Take off heat and set
aside. This will be your dipping solution.

Preheat oven to 400 deg F Sift flours and soda together and mix
homogeneously. Add honey and slowly add buttermilk while working with
hands until it is a firm dough. With a pin, roll dought into a flat
sheet. Cut dough in long strips to make large pretzel twists, or cut
into bite sized pieces (like I do!). Dip the prepared pieces of dough
completely into the dipping solution. This will create the brown
crunchy pretzel shell. Once dipped, place on an oven rack (if bite
sized pieces are being made, cover the rack with aluminum foil and
spray with PAM). Sprinkle with course salt if desired.

Cook for 10 minutes of until dark brown on the second oven rack from
the bottom.

This method works great.  Pretzels are basically regular bread dough
dipped in a baking soda solution before baking. The advantage to this
method is that soda bread, a quick bread, has no yeast and does not
require the time needed for rising before cooking. As soon as the
dought is made, it is ready for the oven! Walt MM

Soft Ginger Bread

breads

1 cup butter
1 cup sugar, white
2 teaspoon baking soda (that's soda, not powde; r)
1 cup water (boiling)
1 cup blackstrap molasses
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ginger
1 teaspoon cinnamon
2 3/4 cup white flour
2 large eggs
1/4 cup sugar, powdered
1/4 cup diluted milk (half milk and half wa; ter)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream together the butter and sugar in a
bowl big enough to hold the entire recipe.

Dissolve the baking soda in about 1 cup boiling water.  Add that mixture
and the molasses, salt, ginger, cinnamon and flour to the butter-sugar
cream. Mix only until moistened and evenly distributed.

Lightly beat the eggs, then add them to the bowl and beat the complete
mixture well. Grease a 9 x 13 shallow baking pan (or a 10-inch round
casserole dish). Pour the mixture into the dish. Bake for about 45 minutes,
or until a poked toothpick comes out clean.

Mix the powdered sugar and the diluted milk together to form an icing, and
brush on to the gingerbread.

Serve warm! You can make a refreshing variation on this basic recipe by
replacing about 1 cup of the flour with whole-wheat flour, reducing the
sugar to about 1/2 cup and increasing the molasses to about 1 1/4 cups.

I make the variation they call Peanut Blossoms.

Shape as above; DO NOT FLATTEN.  Bake as above.  Press milk chocolate
candy kiss (unwrapped) in center of each ball IMMEDIATELY after
baking.

Be sure to have the kisses unwrapped by the time the cookies are done
baking. Press the kiss well in to the cookie so it stays better. The
cookie will spread out as you press, leaving cracks and gaps along
the outside edge.

1 pkg active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water
1 1/2 cup milk
3 tablespoon lard or shortening
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon sugar
4 cup all purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 each oil

In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. In another bowl
combine milk, lard, salt and sugar. Heat to 110 degrees and add to
dissolved yeast. Beat in 3 cups of the all purpose flour and all of
the whole wheat flour. Add abut 1/2 c all purpose flour and mix until
a stiff sticky dough forms. Place dough on a floured board and knead,
adding more flour as needed, until dough is smooth and nonsticky.
Place doug in a greased bowl turning over to grease top. Cover and let
stand at room temp. 1 hour. Punch dough down. The dough may be coverec
and chilled as long as overnight. Knead dough on alightly floured
board to expel air. Roll dough out, a portion at a time, to slightly
less than 1/8" thick. Cut in 2"X 5" rectangles or 3" squares for
appetizers. Place on lightly floured pans and lightly cover. If you
work quickly you can let cut sopaipillas stay at room temp up to 5
min; otherwise, refrigerate them until all are ready to fry. In a deep
wide frying pan or kettle heat 1 1/2 - 2 inches oil to 350 on a deep
fat frying thermometer. Fry 2 or 3 at a time. When the bread begins to
puff, gently push the bread into the hot oil several times to help it
puff more evenly. Turn several times and cook just until pale gold on
both sides, 1-2 minutes total. Drain on paper towels. Serve
immediately or place in a warm oven until all are fried. Or if made
ahead, cool, cover and chill or freeze. To reheat, bake uncovered in a
300 oven, turnig once, just until warm, 5-8 min. Do not overheat or
they will become hard.Makes 2 dozen large sopaipillas or about 4 dozen
small ones.

Sour Cream Brittlebread

appetizers, breads, cajun

2 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup butter
1 cup sour cream
2 tablespoon creole seasoning
2 tablespoon kosher salt for sprinkling

Preheat the oven to 400F.  Sift together the flour, sugar, salt, and
baking soda into a bowl or food processor. Cut in the butter. Add the
sour cream and Creole Seasoning (see recipe for Creole Seasoning),
and mix to a soft dough.  Roll out paper-thin on a floured board. Cut
into 1-1/2 inch squares.  Sprinkle with kosher salt and place on an
ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 5-8 minutes.  Turn off the heat and
allow the bread to crisp in the oven. Nathalie Dupree describes this
recipe in her book "New Southern Cooking" this way; "This crisp,
cracker-like bread is good just flavored with salt and sour cream.
But add Creole Seasoning and you'll have a hot and spicy appetizer
that will leave your guests begging for the recipe. It's nice to keep
a big airtight cookie jar full of these for snacking."

Sour Cream-Peach Muffins

breads

      ----TOPPING----
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened
      ----MUFFINS----
3  med. peaches, pitted, diced
1/2 cup milk
1  lg. egg
1/2 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 tablespoon butter, melted
2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt

Prepare topping:  In small bowl stir together the flour, sugar and
cinnamon; with a fork, work in the butter until crumbly. Refrigerate
until needed.

Preheat oven to 400F.  Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners or
generously butter the cups and the top of the pan around the muffin
cups. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg. Then whisk in the sour cream,
milk, vanilla and melted butter.  Stir in the diced peaches. In a
large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking
soda and salt. Pour in the sour cream-peach mixture all at once and
stir quickly, just to moisten; the batter will be thick and lumpy.
Spoon into muffin cups, dividing it equally until the cups are full.
Quickly crumble the topping over the batter. Bake at 25 to 30 minutes
or until golden brown. The tops will spring back when lightly
touched.  Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes and then carefully remove
and cool on a rack. Cool 10 to 15 minutes. Serve warm.

Sour Dough Starter #7

breads

1 cup milk
1 cup flour

To Begin, place one cup milk in a glass jar or crock (nothing metal)
and allow to stand at room temperature for 24 hours.
Stir in 1 cup flour. (To speed the process, cover with cheese cloth
and place out doors for several hours to expose dough to the wild
yeast cells floating in the wind.)
Leave uncovered in a warm place (80 is ideal) for 2 to 5 days,
depending on how long it takes to bubble and sour. (May be kept near
pilot light on gas range.) If it starts to dry out, stir enough
moderately warm water to bring back to the original consistancy. ONce
it has a good sour aroma and is full of bubbles, it is ready to use.
As you use replace with equal parts milk and flour.

Sour Pumpernickel Bread**

breads

1 cup sourdough starter
2 cup nonfat milk
2  tbl. blackstrap molasses
1/4 cup unsaturated oil
1 cup unbleached white flour
1 cup whole rye flour
2 cup whole wheat flour
1  second day prep:
1  tbl. salt
1  scant 1/2 tsp. baking soda
1/2 cup whole rye flour
1 1/2 cup to 2 c unbleached enriched white fl; our
1 tablespoon caraway seeds
1/4 cup cornmeal
1  the glaze: optional
1 single egg yolk
1 tablespoon water
1 tablespoon caraway seeds

Yield: 3 loaves The texture of this loaf is medium-light making is
perfect for sandwiches and toasting. The overnight rise makes this
pumpernickel easier to knead than most rye recipes. Hints: Spray the
loaves with water to develop a good thick crust. Rye flour can make
for a heavy bread, so don't force in more of the white flour than
required to handle the dough. If you don't want the shininess or the
caraway seeds of the glaze, that step can be omitted.

SOUR PUMPERNICKEL BREAD FIRST DAY PREP: Make up the sponge by
combining in a large bowl all the first-day ingredients, mixing in
the flour 1 cup at a time until the mixture is wet and smooth. Cover
with a wet towel and allow to stand overnight in a draft free place.
At least 12 hours later, stir the sponge down to its original size.
Sprinkle the salt and soda over the surface, then stir in. Stir in
the rye flour. Pour 1 C. of the white flour over your kneading
boards, scrape the batter onto it, and knead the flour in. Then knead
in the caraway seeds. This dough never completely stops sticking, so
you can expect to use another 1/2 C. of white flour to sprinkle the
board and your hands as you knead for another 5 min. to achieve a
dough that can just be handled. Grease two baking sheets and sprinkle
them with white cornmeal. Tap the sheets to spread the cornmeal
evenly. Divide the dough into thirds and shape into three oblong
loaves. Place two loaves on one sheet and one loaf on the other,
leaving room between the loaves for spreading. With a sharp knife or
single-edge razor, slash each loaf diagonally with three slashes, 1/4
to 1/2-inch deep. Cover the loaves with a dry linen dish towel and
put into a warm, draft-free place to rise for 2-3 hours. The loaves
will look well risen and the slashes will gape wide. Gently, slash
again into the same slashes, but only 1/8" deep. Spray the loaves
with water. Starting in a cold oven set at 375^, bake for 40 minutes.
After the loaves have been in the oven for 10 min., pull forward and
spray them again with water. After 30 min., apply the glaze: Mix the
egg yolk and water together, brush thinly over the loaves with a
pastry brush, then quickly sprinkle with caraway seeds. After 40
min., when the loaves are =almost= done, shut off the oven and allow
to sit in the closed oven for another 10 minutes. This AVOIDS
scorching. Cool on a wire rack and serve warm.

Sour Rye Bread

breads

9 teaspoon yeast (2 pkg.)
1 1/2 cup water, warm
2 cup rye flour,  medium or stone ground
1 cup beer, warm
6 cup flour, all-purpose (approx)
1/4 cup sugar
4 teaspoon caraway seed (optional)
1 teaspoon salt
1  egg
3 teaspoon vegetable oil
1  egg white; beaten with 2 tsp water

In large mixer bowl, dissolve half of yeast in warm water. Add rye
flour; stir until well mixed.  Cover bowl tightly w/plastic wrap. Let
stand (room temp) for 3 days. Then add remaining yeast & the beer;
mix well. Stir in 3 cups of the all purpose flour, sugar, half
Caraway seed, salt and
the egg, lightly beaten. Beat at moderate speed until smooth,
about 2 min. Add oil; beat at high speed for 2 min. Add enough flour
to make soft dough. Turn dough out onto a floured board. Knead in
remaining flour & knead about 5 min. Place in greased bowl, and let
rise until doubled. Punch down and form into 2 braided loaves. Brush
with egg white/water, sprinkle with Caraway seeds, and let rise
again.    Bake at 350, about 40 min.

You can vary this by using 3 different seeds on the outside of each
braid "rope".  Try poppy seed, sesame seed, and caraway, for a change.

Sourdough

breads

3 cup unbleached all-purpose
1  flour, divided
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
2 cup hot (120f to 130f) water
1 cup lukewarm (100f) water
1  sourdough starter

Yield : Approximately 4 cups Difficulty: (one chocolate kiss, or easy)
Prepartion: 10 minutes Allow at least 4 days for the starter to
ferment before using. "Day 1: 1. In a medium bowl, stir together 2
cups of the flour and yeast.  Make a well in the middle of the
flour/yeast mixture and whisk in the hot water. Continue stirring
until the mixture is blended but not completely smooth. It is not
necessary to smooth out all the lumps; they will dissolve as the
mixture start to ferment. Cover the bowl with a clean towel and let
the mixture sit at room temperature. Over the next 24 hours the
mixture will rise, become very bubbly and then start to recede.

"Days 2 and 3: 2. Stir the mixture twice, once in the morning and
once in the evening to invigorate the yeast and to expel the alcohol.
Towards the end of the second day the mixture will start to thin and
the surface of the starter will be covered with lots of tiny air
bubbles. By the evening of the third day a thin layer of yellow-brown
liquid may form on the surface of the starter. It is simply the
alcohol given off by the yeast cells as they feed on the
carbohydrates in the flour and multiply. Refresh the starter by
stirring in the cup of lukewarm water (100F) and the remaining cup of
flour. Stir until blended, but do not worry about any small lumps.

"Day 4: 3. The starter is now ready to use, or it may be poured into a
sterilzed 2 quart glass or ceramic covered crock or casserole, or a
flass jar with a non-metal lid and refrigerated.

Sourdough Basics From Starter To Finish

breads, sourdough

1  info

"Those hot griddlecakes the forty-niners forked from the frying pan
before setting out to dig for gold were, no doubt, sourdough
pancakes. The hot biscuits so treasured by cowboys riding the dusty
trail were most likely sourdough biscuits.  The life sustaining bread
baked by pioneer women in crude stone ovens was probably sourdough
bread. After the California gold rush, when the Klondike prospectors
sailed from San Francisco to Alaska, they carried precious sourdough
starter with them - and ever since sourdough bread has been
assiciated with San Francisco. And in Alaska, a prospector with a pot
of sourdough strapped to his back was quickly nicknamed a "sourdough".

"As the population swelled westward during the last century, the
practice of keeping a small amopunt of yesterday's dough alive to
"start" tomorrow's bread was carried from one coast to the next, just
as it had been carried from the Old World to the New. Archaeologists
claim that leavened bread was first developed around 4,000 B.C., when
using starters must have been the only way to accomplish leavening.
Surely ancient bakers guarded their supplies zealously, just as
thousands of years later propectors would tuck the sourdough pot into
their bedroll at night to keep it warm and safe.

"To this day, the distinctive flavor of so many European and Russian
breads, as well as the famous San Francisco version of sourdough
bread, is derived from the use of a sourdough starter. A starter is
simply a self-perpetuating yeast mixture.  Traditionally it was made
by mixing flour and water with a cooked potato or fruit such as wine
grapes or ripe bananas.  Organisms in the flour and the germenting
fruit attracted the wild yeast spores ubiquitous in an unpollouted
environment, and a starter was easy to begin.  Today, this method is
not always reliable owing to variables such as chlorinated water and
pesticide treated flour, fruits and vegetables.

"We've developed an easy sourdough starter by combining unbleached
all-purpose flour, bakers active dry yeast, and water. With minimal
care, the starter can be maintained for years and stored in the
refrigerator (see box).  Since yeast is a single-cell fungus, its
metabolic activity causes fermentation. As the yeast cells multiply
and feed on the carbohydrates in the flour - which in turn give off
carbon dioxide, alcohol and other compounds - the ongoing activity
gives the sourdough starter its sour aroma and tart flavor.

"Keeping a pot of sourdough going in your refrigerator opens up all
sorts of possibilities.  Breads have an assertive tang and keep
longer than other home-baked breads. Biscuits share the same
distinctive flavor and are moist and fluffy.  Sourdough pancakes have
a delicate texture and a subtle flavor that your family will clamor
for on Sunday mornings. We're sure that once you begin baking with
sourdough, you will become a convert for life.

"SOURDOUGH STARTER MAINTENANCE

"o Using and maintaining a sourdough starter is a cyclical process;
you must always replace what you remove from the crock. If well
maintained, a sourdough culture will last a lifetime.  Each time you
take a portion of the starter for a recipe, replace that amount with
equal quantities of water and flour. For example, if you remove 1 cup
of starter to make Sourdough Country Bread, you must replace it with
1 cup of lukewarm water (100F) and 1 cup of unbleached all-purpose
flour. Whisk these ingredients into the starter until blended but not
completely smooth. Any remaining lumps will dissolve as the mixture
ferments. Cover and leave the starter at room temperature for at
least 12 hours or overnight. The starter is now ready to be used
again, or can be refrigerated.

"o Use a 2-quart non-metal crock or bowl to store the starter. This
wat, the replenishing starter ingredients can be mixed directly in
the storage container.

"o Maintain the starter by stirring it at least once a week. This
invigorates the yeast and expels some of the alcohol. If you do not
use the starter every two weeks or so, refresh it by removing 1 cup
of the starter (give it to a friend or discard it), and adding 1 cup
of unbleached all-purpose flour and 1 cup of lukewarm (100F) water.
Whisk until blended. Cover and leave at room temperature 12 hours or
overnight before returning it to the refrigerator.

"o If you plan to be away or know you will not use the starter
frequently, freeze it in a sterilized, air-tight freeezer container.
Thaw the starter two days before you plan on baking with it,
transferring it to a 2 quart non-metal storage container.  Refresh
the starter withg 1 cup each of water and flour. Cover and leave at
room temperature for 12 hours or overnight before using.  It's a good
idea to freeze the starter in two containers; you can keep the second
one frozen indefinitely to serve as a backup should anything happen
to the thawed starter."

Sourdough Bread (Bob's)

breads

6 cup flour (all-purpose or bread)
1 tablespoon buckwheat flour
1 tablespoon bran
1 pkg yeast (1 tbsp)
2 cup sourdough starter
2 3/4 cup warm (105-115 f) water
1 tablespoon malt extract, powdered & unflavored
2 teaspoon salt

Make a yeast sponge by mixing the starter with 1 cup warm water and 1
1/4 cups flour. Cover the bowl with a towel and place in a warm spot
for 24 hours. At that time, stir down the sponge and put 1/2 of it
back into a jar and store in the fridge for your next baking.

To make the bread: mix the yeast with 1 1/2 cups of warm water and
allow to proof for 10 minutes. (Note: I sometimes use a mixture of
beer and water to proof the yeast in, as it adds to the flavor of the
bread.) Add the yeast mixture to the sponge, add the buckwheat flour,
bran, malt extract, and salt. Mix well, then add the flour a cup at a
time to form a soft dough. (Note: the 6 cups includes the 1 1/4 cups
used in the sponge, so you will be adding 4 1/2 to 5 cups to make the
dough) After adding 3-4 cups, turn the dough out on a floured surface
and knead for 12 minutes adding the rest of the flour as the dough
gets sticky. The dough should be soft and elastic, add only enough
flour to get to this point where the dough is no longer sticky.
(Note: malt extract can be found at stores selling home-brewing and
wine making supplies as well as some health food stores.)

Place the dough in an oiled bowl and turn to coat; let rise in a warm
spot until doubled in bulk. Punch down the dough, remove from the
bowl and knead for a couple of minutes. Let the dough rest for 5-10
minutes, then cut in half and shape into 2 oval loaves.

Cover the loaves with a towel and let rise until doubled or more (1-2
hours). Allow the dough to rise in a cool spot for several hours to
develop more of the sourdough flavor.

Bake the bread in a preheated 400 F oven for 15 minutes, then lower
the heat to 350 F for the next 15-20 minutes. Then reduce the oven to
325 F for the final 15-25 minutes until the loaves are done. This
lowering of the heat attempts to duplicate the falling heat in a
baker's wood fired oven. Test the loaves for doneness by rapping on
the bottoms, it is done when it sounds hollow. Cool on a rack before
storing (if it lasts long enough to store!)

Sourdough Chocolate Cake

breads, cakes, chocolate

1/2 cup sourdough starter
1 1/2 cup all purpose flour
2 cup sugar
3/4 cup powdered cocoa (not instant)
2 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3/4 cup cold coffee
1 teaspoon vanilla

Few people bake cakes from scratch anymore unless they can produce
something that's not possible with a mix. This sourdough chocolate
cake falls in that category. It's got a fudge-like quality you can't
get any way except with sourdough and since it's all mixed in one
bowl, it's almost as easy as a boxed cake.

Put the starter in a large bowl, cover loosely and allow to stand at
room temperature until active and bubbling -- at least one hour. Then
add the rest of the ingredients, in the order given, beating well
after each addition.  It is not necessary to sift or premix any of
the ingredients as long as you are careful to get the baking powder
and soda evenly mixed.

Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, pour in the batter,
which will be thin, and bake in a preheated 350. oven for about 30
minutes, or until the layers test done when poked with a toothpick.
The cake will have pulled away from the sides of the pan.

Allow to cool about 10 minutes before removing from pans, then finish
cooling the layers on wire racks. Do not frost until the cake is
completely cold.

A mild chocolate butter cream frosting is nice with this cake.

Sourdough French Bread

breads, sourdough

1 cup sourdough starter
1/2 cup milk (any type, but i prefer whole; milk)
1 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon shortening
2 1/2 cup flour

Combine milk, sugar, salt and shortening in a pan.  Heat until shortening
melts, then cool to lukewarm (about 110 degrees F.).

Stir milk into starter.  Add flour gradually, forming dough that pulls away
from sides of the bowl.  Knead until smooth (about 15 minutes), adding
flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking to the board. When done,
the dough will be fairly heavy, but smooth in texture.

Place in a well-greased bowl and raise in a warm place until doubled. Form
into a long loaf (about 16 inches long).  Place on a greased baking sheet
and let rise again, until almost doubled.

Cut diagonal slits in top of loaf with a sharp knife and bake in a 400
degree oven until done, about 30-35 min. Remove from pan and let cool in a
draft-free location.

NOTES:

*  An old-fashioned sourdough French bread -- This is a hearty bread,
possibly heavier than many people are used to. The flavor is wonderfully
tangy and complements just about any meal. Try it with garlic butter!

This bread is slow raising.  I usually spend two days on it, start the
dough one day, let it rise overnight, then form the loaf and bake the next
day. This recipe is from "The Complete Sourdough Cookbook," by Don and
Myrtle Holm.

*  Be careful that the milk mixture has cooled before adding it to the
starter.   If it's too hot, you'll kill the starter and the bread won't
rise.

*  Since the dough rises for a long time, I usually cover it with a damp
towel to keep it from drying out.

*  If you want a chewy crust, brush the top of the loaf with a mixture of
corn starch and water before baking. Also, placing a pan of water in the
oven while baking will make the crust a little softer. I usually brush the
loaf with butter after baking.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  1 hour preparation, long rising time, 1/2 hour baking.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.

Sourdough French Bread #3

breads

3 cup all-purpose flour (i use unbleached; gold medal)
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 pkg dry yeast
1 cup sourdough starter

In a large bowl... Mix the dry yeast in body-heat water (about 1/4 to
1/2 cup) Add 2 cups of the flour, the starter, salt and sugar and
stir for about 10 minutes

When smooth, cover with a damp towel and let rise for at least 1 1/2
hours

Stir in one cup of flour, or enough to make the dough rigid.

Knead dough on a well-floured bread board for 10-15 minutes Roll into
a long loaf or form into a round ball, depending on your preference
Place on a baking sheet sprinkled with corn meal Cover with a damp
towel and let rise for at least 1 1/2 hours

(with this recipe the long rise times allow you to enjoy a ball game,
read the Sunday paper, trim your toe nails, and mow the lawn)

Place a pan in the bottom of the oven, and fill it with boiling water
(this, she told me, is the secret weapon)

Mix 1/2 t of cornstarch in about 1/4 cup of hot water

Make several diagonal slices in the top of the loaf to prevent it from
breaking up when it fills with steam; brush the loaf with the corn
starch mixture

Place the loaf (on the bread pan sprinkled with corn meal) in the oven
above the water pan and bake at 400 degrees for 10-12 minutes

Remove from the oven, and brush again with the corn starch mixture

Remove the water pan from the oven and refill it with cold water

Place the bread and water pan back in oven (water pan below the
bread) and bake for about 25 minutes

Sourdough French Bread~ San Francisco Style

breads, french

1 1/2 cup hot water
1 pkg active dry yeast
1 cup sourdough starter
4 cup unsifted flour
2 teaspoon sugar
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon soda
1  about 2 cups unsifted flour.

Dissolve yeast in hot water, pour into large mixing bowl and mix with
starter. Add 4 cups flour, sugar and salt and stir vigorously for 3
or 4 minutes. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until
double in bulk (1 1/2 to 2 hours). Mix soda with 1 cup of the
remaining flour and stir in; the dough will be stiff. Turn dough out
onto a floured board and begin kneading; add the remaining 1 cup
flour or more if necessary to control the stickiness. Knead until
satiny -- between 5 and 10 minutes.

Shape into oblong loaves or one large round loaf (my preference).
Place on a lightly greased cooky sheet, cover, and place in a warm
place; let rise to nearly double in size -- time will depend on
warmth of spot ~- 1 1/2 to 2 hours in most kitchens.

Before baking, brush outside with water, make diagonal slashes across
the top with a sharp single edge razor blade. Put a shallow pan of
hot water in the bottom of the oven. Bake in a hot oven -- 400 egrees
~- until the crust is a medium dark brown (about 45 minutes for
oblong loaves and about 55 minutes for the large round loaf).

For a more sour bread, leave out the yeast and 1/4 c of water but
include the rest of the warm water, all the starter, 4 cups of flour,
sugar and salt. Set this sponge after stirring vigorously in the
afternoon and allow to set over night in a covered bowl. In the
morning dissolve the yeast in 1/4 c of hot water and stir thoroughly
into the sponge. Then add your additional flour and soda and follow
the remainder of the instructions from there.

Sourdough Italian Bread

breads, sourdough, italian, starter

1 1/4 cup starter
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup lukewarm water
1 1/2 cup flour
2  cakes or packages yeast
1 1/3 cup lukewarm water
1/2 cup plus 1 tsp. grated romano or parmes; an cheese
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper (coarse)
4  to 5 cups flour
1 teaspoon sesame seed

Early in the morning combine the starter, 1 tsp. salt, 1 cup lukewarm
water and 1-1/2 cups flour.  Beat to blend thoroughly. Cover with a
clean towel and set aside for approximately 5 hours. If the sponge
has to set for a little longer or shorter period of time, it won't be
hurt.

When ready to finish the dough, stir the sponge down. Dissolve the
yeast in the lukewarm water and add to the sponge. Now stir in the
next 4 ingredients in the order given, adding 4 cups flour first, and
then using the other cup of flour if needed.  Turn the dough out onto
a lightly floured breadboard and knead thoroughly, about 7 to 10
minutes. Then return the dough to a buttered bowl, cover with a clean
towel, and set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. When
doubled, punch the dough down and set aside, covered, for another 1/2
hour.

Now turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board again, and divide
into 6 pieces of dough.  Roll and stretch each piece of dough into a
long rope. Braid 3 of the ropes together for each loaf. Tuck the ends
under, and lift each braid into a buttered glass loaf pan. Cover and
set aside to rise until doubled again, about 1 hour. Brush loaves
with melted butter and sprinkle each loaf with a mixture of 1 tsp.
each sesame seed and grated Romano or Parmesan cheese. Bake loaves in
375 oven until browned and done, about 40 to
45    minutes.

Sourdough Rye Starter

breads

2 cup rye flour
1 tablespoon yeast
1 1/2 cup lukewarm water
1  onion slice optional

In a glass or ceramic bowl, or jar that has been scalded, combine
flour and yeast, add water and blend well. Add onion slice, cover
with platic wrap and pierce plastic with fork to release gases. Place
in a warm, draft-free place, at an even 85F for 3 days.; stir several
times daily. Remove onion slice and refrigerate until ready to use.
Onion imparts a strong flavor and this starter can only be used with
compatible rye recipes; rye starter without onion can be used in any
rye sourdough recipe. To replenish, always use rye flour. If starter
does not seem bubbly after replenishing and standing 12 hrs, sprinkle
1 t yeast over and stir in well. Like whole wheat starter, you may
have to plan longer rising times for dough made with this one.

Sourdough Starter

breads, sourdough

2 cup water, warm (about 110 degrees f.)
2 1/2 cup flour
1 pkg yeast (dry), active (optional)

Get a container for the starter.  Crockery is best, but just about anything
can be used, except metal.  Try to get something with a lid. I use a vinyl
plastic food-storage container.

Mix flour and water (and optionally yeast).  Let the starter sit (uncovered
or loosely covered) in a warm place until bubbly and sour, about 3-5 days.

If you do a lot of bread baking, there will probably be enough yeast spores
floating around your kitchen so that the added yeast isn't needed. The less
yeast you add to the starter, the more "authentic" the flavor.

If the starter starts turning orange or green, throw it away.  Other nasty
things have started growing in it!

After the starter is ready, it can be used immediately.  Try to use some of
the starter once every few days, or it will start to die. The starter can
be refrigerated to last longer (use at least every other week). Make sure
the starter is at room temperature before using.

After using some of the starter, replenish what you take with equal amounts
of warm water and flour. Let the starter sit until nice and bubbly before
using again.

NOTES:

*  Starter culture for making sourdough bread -- Many people think of
sourdough as something from the Gold Rush days.  Not so!  Sourdough was the
first way raised breads were made.  "Way back then," there was no such
thing as yeast (dry), active, and all breads (along with a number of other
goodies) needed sourdough starter to rise.

There are a number of recipes for sourdough starter, but this is one I've
used, and it works fairly well.  It came originally from the cookbook "The
Complete Sourdough Cookbook" by Don Holm.

*  Usually, the first starter made will need a while to "come up to
strength." Best bets for first recipes are ones that don't require much
raising, such as pancakes, or ones that have additional yeast.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 5 days waiting.

days. When it starts working well and smells right, it is ready to
use. NOTE: All containers for starters not using yeast, must be
carefully scalded before use.  If you are carless or do not scald
them the starter will fail.

Sourdough Starter #14

breads

4 cup lukewarm water
1 pkg activated dry yeast
1 tablespoon vinegar; very important<
1/4 cup sugar
5 cup unbleachd flour

Pour the water into a crock or a wide mouth gallon jar. Pour in the
yeast and let it dissolve. Stir. Add vinegar, sugar and flour. Mix.
Cover w/cloth and set in a warm place to sour..(2 to 3 days). When
activity STOPS, the mixture flattens out. An amber colored liquor
comes to the top..And it SMELLS.. THAT'S IT! Mix it up. It will look
like whipping cream. Put it in a GLASS JAR with a screw type lid;
place in refrigerator. IT WILL KEEP FOR MONTHS. Growing better as it
continues to age at a very slow pace. I have no idea regarding
conversion for use in BM. IF YOU DO.. Let ME know..Ho-Kay? It is
super in pancakes; waffles; coffee cake; rolled bisquits; quick drop
bisquits; cinnamon rolls; cobbler; BREAD; cake; oatmeal cookies;

Sourdough Starter #15

breads

1 3/4 cup flour
1 3/4 cup water; warm (110-115f) wate
1 pkg yeast; (not rapid rise, i
1 tablespoon sugar

Mix well in glass, plastic or ceramic bowl.(use no metal) Sit on
counter, cover with cloth and stir 3 x day for 5-10 days, until it
separates into thick creamy bottom and a thin grey-yellow top (the
'wine'). Now ready to use. I store it on my counter as I use every 3
days or less. I store rarely used beer starter in fridge. Always feed
(or replenish) every 10 days, either by removing 1 cup and throwing
it away or giving away, and adding 3/4 c flour and 3/4 c water to
remainder, or by stirring in 1 tsp sugar. I cover with a cheesecloth,
doubled. The consistency ranges from thin cream to cake batter,
depending on proportions of flour and water, and weather. Oh, the
starter might look "dead" to you at times, but just replenish and see
if it starts bubbling within about 4 hours, if so, it is still alive
and kicking. Hope I got it all in, write if you need more info...

Sourdough Starter #8

breads, sourdough

3 cup unbleached all-purpose
1  flour, divided
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
2 cup hot (120f to 130f) water
1 cup lukewarm (100f) water
1  sourdough starter

Yield : Approximately 4 cups Difficulty: (one chocolate kiss, or easy)
Prepartion: 10 minutes Allow at least 4 days for the starter to
ferment before using. "Day 1: 1. In a medium bowl, stir together 2
cups of the flour and yeast.  Make a well in the middle of the
flour/yeast mixture and whisk in the hot water. Continue stirring
until the mixture is blended but not completely smooth. It is not
necessary to smooth out all the lumps; they will dissolve as the
mixture start to ferment. Cover the bowl with a clean towel and let
the mixture sit at room temperature. Over the next 24 hours the
mixture will rise, become very bubbly and then start to recede.

"Days 2 and 3: 2. Stir the mixture twice, once in the morning and
once in the evening to invigorate the yeast and to expel the alcohol.
Towards the end of the second day the mixture will start to thin and
the surface of the starter will be covered with lots of tiny air
bubbles. By the evening of the third day a thin layer of yellow-brown
liquid may form on the surface of the starter. It is simply the
alcohol given off by the yeast cells as they feed on the
carbohydrates in the flour and multiply. Refresh the starter by
stirring in the cup of lukewarm water (100F) and the remaining cup of
flour. Stir until blended, but do not worry about any small lumps.

"Day 4: 3. The starter is now ready to use, or it may be poured into a
sterilzed 2 quart glass or ceramic covered crock or casserole, or a
flass jar with a non-metal lid and refrigerated.

Sourdough Upkeep #2

breads, sourdough

1  sourdough info

Recipe by: KKPD13B    Linda Caldwell I've found another interesting
quote from Donna German regarding the feeding and care of your
sourdough starter. "If you're using the culture every month or so,
you don't have to feed it at all.  If the relationship sours, so to
speak, and you decide to break it off for a while, the question of
maintenance comes up in case you patch things >> over and want to
have another "wild fling" Store the culture in a refrigerator, and
then warm it up and feed it about once every 6 months. The longer it
lies dormant, the more TLC is needed to bring it back. Feeding every
12 hours for 3 to 4 days with vigorous stirring will always rescue
it." My particular starter is staging a nice comeback right now.
Think I'll do a lovely SD round loaf and bake it on my stone! Linda

Sourdough Whole Wheat Herb Bread Bm

breads

      ----PLACE IN BREADMAKER----
1/3 cup water; warm, 105 degrees
1 cup sourdough starter
1/2 cup salad dressing, creamy onion
1  eggs
1/2 teaspoon sage
1/2 teaspoon thyme leaves
1/2 teaspoon basil leaves
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
2 cup flour, whole wheat
1 1/2 cup flour
2 teaspoon yeast
      ----ADD AT BEEP----
1 cup cheese, cheddar, shredded

Sylvia's comments: this came out great except that the dough looked
too dry, so I added a tiny bit more water and it overrose, with a
texture a little too coarse to suit me. Next time I'll just use the
amount of water called for.

If you don't want whole wheat, but prefer a white bread base,
substitute 3-1/2 cups bread or AP flour for the 2 Cups whole wheat
AND the 1-1/2 cups bread or AP flour measurements.

Sourdough Yeast Starter

breads, pancakes

1 pkg dry yeast
2 cup warm water
2 cup flour

1. Empty yeast into mixing bowl and stir in warm water until
dissolved. Add flour and stir until well blended. Cover with
plastic wrap and allow to  stand at room temperature (or in oven
out of drafts) for at least 48 hours, or until hooch (clear liquid)
forms on top. 2. Store in refrigerator in a jar with a loose
fitting lid (I like to use
a plastic peanut butter jar) . Renew monthly by adding alternately
1  cup of water or 1 cup of milk, and 1 cup of flour. 1/4 cup of
sugar may be added every other month to add to the fermentation. 3.
Always save at least one-cup of the fermented mixture to use as
on-going starter. If recipe calls for 3 cups of starter, add 3 cups
of milk (or water) and three cups of flour. Allow to stand until
clear liquid forms on top. Save 1-cup for future use and use the
extra 3 cups in the recipe.

the mixture sit at room temperature. Over the next 24 hours the
mixture will rise, become very bubbly and then start to recede.

"Days 2 and 3: 2. Stir the mixture twice, once in the morning and
once in the evening to invigorate the yeast and to expel the alcohol.
Towards the end of the second day the mixture will start to thin and
the surface of the starter will be covered with lots of tiny air
bubbles. By the evening of the third day a thin layer of yellow-brown
liquid may form on the surface of the starter. It is simply the
alcohol given off by the yeast cells as they feed on the
carbohydrates in the flour and multiply. Refresh the starter by
stirring in the cup of lukewarm water (100F) and the remaining cup of
flour. Stir until blended, but do not worry about any small lumps.

"Day 4: 3. The starter is now ready to use, or it may be poured into a
sterilzed 2 quart glass or ceramic covered crock or casserole, or a
flass jar with a non-metal lid and refrigerated.

Southern Banana Bread

breads

2 cup unbleached flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1 cup sugar
2  eggs
1 cup mashed, ripe bananas
1/3 cup buttermilk
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Everyone has banana bread recipes, but this one uses buttermilk which
I thought was interesting.

Banana bread is made all over the Northern Hemisphere but this recipe
is from the South.

Combine flour, soda and salt in a mixing bowl.  Cream butter with
sugar and beat in eggs with bananas, buttermilk and vanilla. Stir
into dry ingredients and fold in nuts. Spoon into a greased 9 x
5-inch pan and bake in a preheated 350F oven for about an hour, or
until bread tests done in the center.

Makes 1 loaf.

1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup vegetable shortening
4 oz diced canned green chilies (
1/2 cup grated cheddar cheese
3/4 cup milk
1 pinch black or cayenne pepper

HEAT THE OVEN TO 450F. Combine flour, baking powder, salt and pepper
in a large mixing bowl. Cut in the vegetable shortening using a
pastry blender or two knives until the mixture has the consistency of
coarse crumbs. Add the chilies, cheese and milk, adding more milk if
necessary so the dough is pliable but is still wet. Turn the dough
onto a heavily floured surface, and knead it lightly (8 to 10 times).
Do not overwork the dough. Roll the dough to an even thickness of
3/4-to-1 inch, and cut out biscuits with a 2-inch round cutter (the
diameter of a juice can), dipping the cutter in flour between cutting
each biscuit so they do not stick. Place the biscuits on an ungreased
cookie sheet and bake in the center of the oven for 12 to 15 minutes,
or until golden brown. Serve immediately, or bake up to 2 hours in
advance and reheat for 5 minutes in a 300F oven. Makes 12 to 14.

SPAETZLE

Lightly spoon flour into measuring cup; level off. In large bowl,
combine flour, 1/4 tsp salt and nutmeg. By hand, beat eggs into flour
mixture. Gradually adding milk, stirring constantly until mixture
forms a smooth, soft, moist dough. If dough is too thick, add

water returns to a boil, cook uncovered for 5-7 minutes or until

2 cup all purpose flour
2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon salt
1  granulated sugar for dipping the ba; lls of dough.

extra minute or two in the oven if a crisp cookie is desired.

In a bowl cream the shortening with the brown sugar until the mixture
is light and fluffy and stir in the egg and the molasses. Into
another bowl sift together the flour, the baking soda, the cinnamon,
the ginger, the cloves and the salt, add the flour mixture in batches
to the shortening mixture, and blend the dough well. Chill the dough,
covered, for 1 hour.

Roll level tablespoons of the dough into balls, dip one side of each
ball into the granulated sugar, and arrange the balls, sugared sides
up, about 3 inches apart on greased baking sheets. Bake the cookies
in batches in the middle of a preheated 375 degree F oven for 10 to
12 minutes, or until they are puffed and cracked on top. transfer the
cookies with a metal spatula to racks and let them cool.  Makes about
40 cookies.

Spiced Peach Bread

breads

2 cup starter
1 1/2 cup cold water
1 1/2 cup white flour
1 1/2 cup syrup from commercial or home-canne; d spiced peaches
6 oz box peach flavored gelatin
1/2 cup warm water
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon ginger
1 pkg dry yeast
1 cup dried skim milk powder
3 cup white flour
1/2 teaspoon yellow food coloring (if desired)
1/2 cup soft butter
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
3 1/2 cup white flour

Empty starter from glass jar into large mixing bowl. Add 1-1/2 cups
cold water and 1-1/2 cups flour.  Beat thoroughly. Cover tightly and
set in a warm place overnight.

In the morning stir the starter thoroughly.  Pour off 2 cups and set
aside. Pour remaining 2 cups into glass jar, cover and return to
refrigerator. Heat 1-1/2 cups spiced peach syrup. Dissolve 1 large
box peach gelatin in it and cool to just warm.  Mix 1/2 cup warm
water, 1 tsp. sugar, 1/2 tsp. ginger and 1 pkg. dry yeast. Set in
warm place until foaming nicely. Pour the 2 cups of reserved starter
into mixing bowl. Add the peach syrup and gelatin, 1 cup dried skim
milk, 3 cups white flour and 1/2 tsp. yellow coloring (the bread will
have a rather dull cream color without it). Beat thoroughly.  Add the
dry yeast mixture as soon as ready and beat again. Add 1/2 cup soft
butter, 1-1/2 tsp. salt and 2-1/2 cups white flour. Stir until the
dough clears the bowl. Spread the remaining 1 cup flour on pastry
board.  Turn out dough (it will be very soft) and knead thoroughly
using a little more flour if necessary to make a smooth, non sticky
dough. Return to the bowl, brush top of dough with butter, cover and
set in warm place to rise (this dough is rather slow so give it
plenty of time). When light, turn out, knead well, divide and shape
as desired. Place in buttered pans, brush tops with butter, cover and
set in warm place until light. Bake in oven preheated to 350 degrees
for about 45 minutes for loaves, 25 minutes for rolls. This recipe
makes 4 high, well-rounded small loaves.

Spicy Shortbread Bites

appetizers, breads

2 tablespoon paprika
2 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt
1 1/8 teaspoon cayenne
7 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened
2 tablespoon sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon curry powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin

Preheat oven to 350 deg F In a small bowl, whisk together paprika, 2
ts salt, and 1 ts cayenne and set aside. In a bowl with an electric
mixer, beat butter with sugar until light and fluffy. In another
bowl, whisk together remaining 1/2 ts salt, remaining 1/8 ts cayenne,
flour, curry powder, and cumin. Beat flour mixture into butter
mixture until just combined. On a lightly floured surface, knead
dough about 8 times, or until it just comes together. Divide dough
into 4 equal pieces. On a sheet of wax paper, roll each piece of
dough into a 3/4-inch thick log. Sprinkle one quarter of spice
mixture along the length of each log and roll in mixture to coat
completely. Wrap each log in wax paper. Freeze dough just until firm,
15 to 20 minutes. Shortbread dough may be made 1 week ahead and
frozen. Before proceeding with recipe, remove dough from freezer and
let stand about 15 minutes, or until slightly softened to facilitate
slicing. Remove logs carefully from wax paper and slice into 1/2-inch
thick rounds. Place rounds 1/4-inch apart on ungreased baking sheets
and bake in batches in middle of oven 15 minutes, or until browned
lightly. Gently loosen shortbread bites with a spatula from baking
sheet (do not remove from sheet) and cool completely. Carefully
transfer shortbread bites to a serving dish (they will be fragile)
and serve as hors d'oeuvre. Makes about 140 shortbread bites.

Yield: 140 servings

Spinach & Stilton Pancakes

breads, cheese/eggs, breakfast, vegetarian, pancakes

      ----FOR THE PANCAKES----
2 oz buckwheat flour
2 oz plain white flour
2  eggs
2 tablespoon butter; melted
1/4 pint milk
1/4 pint water
      ----FOR THE FILLING----
2 lb fresh spinich
1 large onion
3 oz stilton cheese
2 oz walnut pieces
1  butter
1  garlic sliver
      ----FOR THE SAUCE----
1 oz butter
1 oz plain white flour
1/2 pint stock
1/4 pint double cream
2 tablespoon freshly grated parmesan
1 teaspoon (heaped) dijon mustard

Make a smooth batter with the flours, eggs, milk and water, then stir
in the cool melted butter for extra richness and to prevent sticking
during cooking.  Use a 6-inch pan and make thin pancakes in the usual
way, but be sure to stir the batter vigorously in between making each
pancake or all the buckwheat flour will sink to the bottom of the
mixture. If preparing ahead, cool the pancakes then stack them
(interleaved with greaseproof paper) and wrap in a foil parcel.

To make the filling, wash and boil or steam the spinach until just
tender. Chop it and squeeze out all the liquid (save the juices for a
soup). Chop the onion finely and sweat it in a knob of butter until
it's deliciously soft.  Stir in the spinach, season with a little
salt, lots of pepper and the garlic. Toast the walnuts and crumbled
Stilton into the spinach mixture to give it savoury flavour and bite.
Stuff the pancakes with the mixture, roll them up neatly and pile
them into a lightly buttered gratin dish. Cover with foil and heat
through in the oven for 25-30 minutes at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6.

Make a smooth rich sauce with the butter, flour, stock (preferably
good chicken stock) and cream.  Let it simmer for about 5 minutes,
stirring once or twice, then season with the cheese, mustard and salt
and pepper. If the sauce is made ahead, reheat it in a double-boiler
for serving, then pour it over the dish of pancakes just before
bringing to table.

Spinach Pizza

breads, main dish

1  crust:
4 1/4 cup flour
1 1/2 cup water, lukewarm (105 to 115
1  degrees fahrenheit)
1 pkg active dry yeast
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoon olive oil
1  topping:
1 bunch spinach, rinsed, stemmed
3 cup mushrooms, sliced
2 tablespoon fresh garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried basil, or 1/4 cup
1  fresh minced
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup mozzarella, grated
1/2 cup tomato sauce

Put flour into a large bowl and make a deep well in the middle. Pour
warm water into the well, mix in the yeast, using a bit of flour in
the mix. Add the sugar, salt, and flour to the well, let stand for 10
minutes until mixture bubbles. Slowly stir all of the flour into the
yeast mixture. When it gets too thick to handle place it on a board
and knead it until elastic. Form a ball, place into a greased bowl,
then turn it over so the top of the ball is greased. Cover with a
towel and let rise in a warm and draft free place for an hour or
until double in bulk. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Punch down dough
and divide in half. Refrigerate one half for later. (Allow extra time
to rise). Roll the other half into a circle about 15 inches across.
Place on a 14 inch greased pizza pan, roll edges to form a rim.

Spread the olive oil and tomato sauce on the pizza pie, top with
shredded mozzarella. Steam the spinach leaves for a few minutes. Toss
spinach with mushrooms, garlic, basil, and olive oil. Spread veggies
on pizza crust. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until edges are brown and
cheese is bubbly. Cut each pie into 6 wedges.

Stollen

breads, christmas, german

1/4 oz yeast (dried), active (1 package)
3/4 cup water, warm
1/2 cup sugar, granulated
3 large eggs
1  egg yolk
1/2 cup butter, soft
3 1/2 cup flour
1 tablespoon lemon peel, grated
1 cup almonds (blanched), chopped
1/2 cup citronat (candied lemon peel), cut; into small pieces
1/2 cup orangenat (candied orange peel), cu; t into small pieces
1/2 cup raisins

Dissolve the yeast in the water and proof it.  Add the sugar, eggs, egg
yolk, butter and half of the flour. Beat for 10 minutes. Blend in the
remaining flour, nuts, fruits and peel. Let rise about 1 1/2 hours, until
doubled. Punch down, cover and refrigerate overnight.

Knead the dough.  Roll into one or two rectangles, butter it, and fold over
the edges to make a rolled loaf.  Place on a greased cookie sheet with the
folded edges down.  Spread with a combination of 1 egg white and about 1 T
water.  Let rise until doubled in size (45 to 60 minutes). Bake 30-35
minutes at 375 degrees F. until golden brown.

NOTES:

*  Traditional German Christmas bread -- Germans traditionally eat Stollen
around Christmas time.  This recipe comes from someone I went to school
with. She, and her parents, who are from southern Germany, recommended it
as quite an authentic recipe. It is indeed a very tasty and rich bread.
Makes 1 large or 2 small loaves.

*  My loaves of stollen come out somewhat wide and short.  Some
traditionalists make them long and narrow.  You can also make them in
normal bread pans instead of on cookies sheets, in which case you should
increase the baking time somewhat.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  hand-on time:  30 minutes;  rising times:  1 1/2 hours + overnight
+ 1 hour; baking time: 30-35 minutes.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients, though you can experiment with the
fruits and nuts.

Strucle Z Makiem

breads, holiday, polish

1/2 oz yeast (dry), active (two standard e; nvelopes)
1/2 cup water, warm
4 1/2 cup flour, all-purpose
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter
2  eggs
2  egg yolks (save whites for the fill; ing)
1/2 cup sour cream
      Vanilla ----POPPY SEED FILLING-----
2 tablespoon butter
10 oz poppy seeds,coarsely ground
2 tablespoon honey
2 teaspoon lemon juice
2  egg whites
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 can Candied orange peel,chopped fine
2 tablespoon lemon peel; grated

MAKE THE DOUGH:  Soften the yeast in warm water in a bowl.  Mix flour with
sugar and salt.  Cut in the butter until mixture has a fine, even crumb.

Beat eggs and extra yolks; mix with yeast, then stir into the flour
mixture. Add the sour cream and the vanilla and mix well.

Knead dough on floured surface for 5 minutes.  Divide in half and roll
each
half into a 12 inch square.  Cover.

MAKE THE FILLING:  Melt butter in a large pan.  Add poppy seed and
stir-fry
for 3 minutes.  Add honey, lemon juice and raisins to poppy seeds. Cover
and remove from heat. Let stand for 10 minutes.

Beat egg whites with sugar until stiff moist peaks form.  Fold in orange
and lemon peels and then gently fold in poppy seed mixture.

Spread half of the filling on each dough square (after you uncover them).
Roll up as you would for a jelly-roll and seal the edges. Place on
greased
baking sheets and cover.  Let rise until doubled in bulk (approx. 1 1/2
hours).

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Bake about 45 minutes, then remove from
oven and cool.

MAKE THE ICING:  Mix powdered sugar and lemon juice until smooth. Spread
this mixture evenly over the rolls.

NOTES:

*  Poppy seed rolls -- This recipe could be used as part of a 12-course
meal known in Polish as Wigilia, or on its own. Wigilia is eaten after
sundown on Christmas Eve. Yield: Makes 2 rolls.

*  You can grind poppy seeds in a mortar and pestle.  Specialty food
stores
sell grinders specifically designed for poppy seeds.  Some spice shops
sell
poppy seeds already ground, but like all spices they lose their freshness
much more rapidly after they are ground. This year (1987) in Poland, the
people are having a very hard time finding enough poppy seeds for their
strucle z makiem because there is a government crackdown on the growing
of
all poppies in an attempt to control opium production.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  3-4 hours including yeast rising time.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

1. In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a
dough hook, sprinkle yeast over warm water. Allow to "bloom" for 5 minutes,
until yeast is active and bubbly.

2. Add honey, millet, sunflower seeds, and white flour. Mix thoroughly
until batter is smooth. Add 2 cups whole wheat flour and beat for 10
minutes.

3. Cover loosely with a clean, damp towel. Set in a warm draft- free place
and allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about 30 minutes.

4. Add salt, oil and 2.1/2 cups whole wheat flour. Knead together until
dough forms a smooth, springy, soft ball that comes cleanly away from bowl
or table. Add additional flour by tablespoons only as needed.

5. Liberally oil a large bowl and place dough in it, turning dough so that
it becomes lightly oiled on all sides. Cover loosely and let sit in a warm
spot until doubled in bulk and the dough does not spring back when lightly
touched.

6. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and place rack in lower third of oven.
Oil two 8 or 9 inch loaf pans.

7. Punch down dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and cut in
half. Form each half into a smooth ball by gently kneading outer edges into
center. Allow to rest 5 minutes. Form each ball into a loaf by flattening
dough into a 12 x 8 x 1.1/2 inch thick rectangle. Beginning from narrow
end, roll up tightly, pinch seam closed, and place, seam side down, in loaf
pan. Cover loosely and allow to rise until doubled in bulk, or until
slightly higher than edges of pans.

8. Bake for 30 minutes, until golden brown and hollow sounding when tapped
on bottom. Remove from oven and turn out onto racks to cool. When cooled,
wrap tightly and store at room temperature for up to 2 days, or freeze for
future use.

Swedish Rye Bread

breads, swedish

2 cup milk
1 cup water
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 oz dry yeast (two packages)
6 cup rye flour (approx)
3 cup flour, white (approx)
1/2 cup sugar, granulated
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup dark molasses
2 teaspoon anise seeds, crushed
1 teaspoon salt

Scald the milk and combine it with the water and brown sugar in a very
large bowl. (You need something that holds at least 4 or 5 quarts.) When
the mixture is lukewarm, dissolve the yeast in it, then stir in about 2
cups rye flour and about 1 cup white flour to make a paste.

Let the mixture rise in a warm place until it is light and foamy. This
usually takes about 30 minutes to an hour.  Check it frequently, it can
really make a mess if it rises enough to overflow the bowl. (I'm sure they
could make a great horror movie about a gigantic blob of bread dough that
keeps getting bigger and bigger as it consumes everything in its path....)

Stir in the granulated sugar, oil, molasses, anise seed and salt, and
enough flour to make a stiff dough, using 2 parts rye to 1 part white.
Knead the dough for about 5 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic,
adding more flour to keep it from sticking to your hands.

Clean and grease the bowl.  Put the dough in the bowl, turning it to grease
all sides.  Cover the bowl loosely with a clean towel and let the dough
rise until it's doubled in bulk. Punch it down and let rise until double
again.

Divide the dough into three loaves and put in greased pans.  (I usually
make round loaves and bake them on cookie sheets.) Cover with the towel and
let rise until double again.

Bake for about 45 minutes at 350 degrees F.  Because of the high sugar
content, this bread can burn rather easily; watch it closely so it doesn't
get too dark.

NOTES:

*  A sweet, dark whole-grain rye bread -- This recipe comes from my
great-grandmother, who emigrated from Sweden and brought this recipe with
her. It makes a sweet, dark bread, and (like most whole-grain breads) it
tends to be a bit heavy. Yield: Makes 3 loaves.

*  Rye flour can be a little hard to find these days.  You may have to
visit a store that specializes in natural foods. Avoid the kind that is
very coarsely ground with big chunks of bran in it, though; this doesn't
seem to have any gluten at all in it, and since the proportion of rye flour
is so high in this recipe, the texture of the bread will come out all
wrong.  You need something that looks more like ordinary flour.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, several hours rising, 1 hour baking and
cooling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.

Tips For Making The Perfect Buttermilk Biscui

breads, breakfast

1  good recipe for biscuits
1  light touch with dough

THE PERFECT BUTTERMILK BISCUIT Thanks to Eula Mae Dore, a great
Southern cook from Avery Plantation, La., I've learned to make the
best Buttermilk Biscuits I've ever had. Eula Mae says a good biscuit
is one of the best things to have on hand for quick meals. She uses
them in emergencies to make simple sandwiches filled with scraps of
ham or cheese and serves them with pickles and a small salad. For
dessert, she warms a biscuit or two and makes a shortcake with fresh
fruits or berries. She has convinced me that you can't have too many
biscuits on hand. Eula Mae learned to cook and bake from her
grandmother, not from cookbooks, and the artfulness of her
preparation was a joy to watch. Here are some of her biscuit-making
tips: + First go out and replace your baking powder, unless you
bought it within the last four months. More baking flops occur from
old, tired baking powder than from any other cause. And don't rely on
the old test of checking the freshness of baking powder by putting a
spoonful in a glass of water to see if it fizzes. Baking powder, like
a carbonated drink, can fizz a little and still be almost flat.
Buying new baking powder costs very little when you consider the cost
of baking failures. + Next, Eula Mae insists that sifting the dry
ingredients four times is the reason her biscuits are perfect. I
tested the recipe sifting and not sifting and, indeed, sifting does
make a slightly higher, more tender biscuit. + After you cut the
biscuit dough, put the pieces on a baking sheet upside down. This
ensures a taller, lighter biscuit by making sure any edges crimped by
the pressure of the cutting don't interfere with the rise. (The
French use the same trick when making puff pastry.) + The tip that
helped me the most was using less flour than usual. Eula Mae's dough
was soft and sticky. She handled it gently, dusting her hands and the
dough with only enough flour to make the dough manageable. The result
was a lighter biscuit.

Tomato Bread W/Herbs

breads, sun-dried

      ----WALDINE VAN GEFFEN VC42A----
2 cup tomato juice
1/2 cup canned tomato sauce
2 tablespoon olive oil
6 cup all-purpose flour; to 6-1/2
2 pkg active dry yeast
3 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon ground rosemary
1/4 teaspoon ground fennel
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
2 small cloves garlic; crushed

Lightly grease large bowl and 2 9x5x3" loaf pans with olive oil. Set
aside. In small saucepan, heat tomato juice, sauce and 2 tb olive oil
to 120~. In large mixer bowl, combine 3 cups flour with yeast and
remaining ingredients. Pour in tomato mixture and beat thoroughly for
3 minutes. Gradually add remaining 3 to 3-1/2 c flour, mixing by hand
if necessary until it holds together enough to turn out onto floured
surface. The dough is quite sticky and you may need to add a tad more
flour, but don't add an excessive amount or you will have a dry
bread. Knead about 5 minutes until dough smooths out. Place dough in
greased bowl, cover and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down, let rest 15 minutes, the shape into 2 loaves and
place in prepared pans. Cover pans and let dough rise an additional
45 minutes or until doubled in size. Preheat oven to 375~. Bake
loaves 10 minutes, reduce heat to 350~ and bake 30 to 40 minutes
more. Bread is done when loaves sound hollow when thumped with
knuckle. Tip loaves out immediately onto wire racks to cool. Source:

Toronto Bran Muffins

breads

1 1/4 cup hot milk
3 each eggs
2 tablespoon oil

Combine cereal with hot milk in a 1-1/2  quart mixing bowl and let it
stand about 10  minutes---or until the cereal has absorbed all of the
milk. With the electric mixer on high speed, beat in the oil and eggs
till completely blended.   Remove the beaters.   Switch to a sturdy
spoon and dump in the cake mix,  stirring only to moisten all of it
thoroughly---but don't overmix or overbeat or the muffin texture will
be heavy and tough. The batter will be a bit lumpy. Cover the bowl
and let the batter stand 15 minutes while you preheat the oven to 400
F, and grease 12 muffin tin wells in Crisco, evenly. Divide batter
equally between the 12 wells. If you are using cupcake tin wells, you
will have 15 muffins. Bake at 400 for 20 to 25 minutes,  or till
golden brown.   Wipe tops of each while still warm in softened
butter  or margarine.

Tortillas De Harina De Trigo

breads

1/4 lb lard or shortening (1/2 cup)
1 lb unbleached flour, sifted
2 teaspoon salt
1 cup hot water

Using the fingers, rub the fat well into the flour. Dissolve the salt
in the water and add it to the flour mixture. Knead the dough wll for
about 3 minutes. Set it aside, covered, for at least 2 hours. Do not
refrigerate. Heat the griddle over a medium flame. Knead the dough
again for a minute or so, then take a piece of the dough and roll it
inot a ball about 1 and 1/2 inches in diameter.  Press the ball out
evenly on a floured board or pastry cloth - you are trying to roll it
out to a paper thin circle about 7 inches in diameter. With each
press of the rolling pin turn the dough around slightly to keep it
circular. Place the tortilla on the griddle - if it is the correct
heat there should be a slight sizzling sound as the dough touches it.
Leave it for 20 seconds, by which time bubbles will appear on the
surface and the underside will be speckled with dark brown. (If it
puffs up, press it back onto the griddle.) Turn the tortilla over and
cook it for a slightly shorter time on the other side. Place the
tortillas, one on top of the other in a polyethylene bag. They should
be thin light and flexible. NOTES: The tortillas can be made several
hours ahead of time and warmed for a few seconds, one at a time on a
hot griddle. They can be stored for several days in the refrigerator
or frozen as long as they are kept flat. There is no need to defrost
them before reheating. Flour should be sifted an weighed if possible.
Crisco works the best for thin tortillas. Weigh the fat at room
temperature. Makes 24 6-inch tortillas. The Cuisines of Mexico Diana

Tortillas De Masa  (Corn Tortillas)

breads, mexican

2 cup masa harina
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon margarine
1 1/4 cup warm water

Mix masa harina and salt.  Add margarine. Add warm water all at once
and use fingers to work mixture into a soft dough. Knead dough until
no longer sticky. Divide dough into 12-16 balls; cover and let dough
rest 20 minutes at room temperature.Place a small square of wax paper
on the bottom part of open tortilla press. Place a ball almost on the
center of the wax paper (a little more towares the hinge of the press
than the handle). Place a second wax paper square, well flattened, on
top of the ball. Close the press down firmly until the torilla
measures about six inches in diameter. Peel the top wax paper off the
dough. Pick up the second wax paper square and place the flattened
dough onto the palm of your hand. Then peel off the wax paper and
place the tortilla onto a moderately hot griddle. In a few seconds
the edges of the tortilla will begin to dry out. At this point, turn
the tortilla. Allow the second side to cook for a slightly longer
period until it is slightly browned. Flip it back onto the first side
and let it finish cooking. Allow 2 minutes cooking time per tortilla.
Delicious served with any Mexican dish.  Serves 6-8.

Notes:

A tortilla press is a cast iron press for pressing corn tortillas and
tamales into flat thin circles.  [One could probably use a (cold)
round waffle iron, assuming that it has a flat (pancake) side in
addition to the bumpy (waffle) side.]

Masa is freshly ground daily at tortilla factories.  Corn is soaked
in lime water and then cooked and rinsed before grinding.  Lime aids
as a preservative and adds color.  Fresh masa is best for tamales and
corn tortillas, but instant masa is also available.

Traditional Buttermilk Biscuits

breads

2 cup a.p. flour, sifted
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon soda
1 cup buttermilk
4 tablespoon shortening

Sift flour, salt and soda together in a medium mixing bowl. Mix in
shortening with the tips of the fingers; add buttermilk and gently
knead into a soft ball of dough. Lift dough onto a well floured
board, knead just until smooth and firm enough to handle. Roll or pat
out to 1/2-inch thickness, and cut with floured cutter, or with knife

Place biscuits on a greased cookie sheet, and bake in a pre-heated
400 F. oven for 10 min., until well browned.

Hint:  For biscuit cutters you may also use empty cans with holes
punched in bottoms to release air. #303 cans are perfect for large
biscuits, and tomato sauce cans (8 oz. size) are just right for small
ones.

Traditional Pizza Dough 1

breads, ethnic

1/4 cup water (110 to 115 f.)
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 pkg dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (110 to 115 degrees f.)
1 tablespoon olive oil (room temperature)
1 1/2 cup unbleached flour
1  additional flour
1  additional water

HAND METHOD:

Pour the first 1/4 Cup of water into a medium bowl and add the
sugar and salt, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Sprinkle the yeast
over the water mixture, stirring once to blend and let sit for 5
minutes until the top is bubbly and the yeast has bloomed. Stir in
the remaining warm water and the oil.  Place the flour in a large
bowl and add the water and oil mixture to it.  Stir, adding enough
flour to make a soft dough that will pull away from the sides of the
bowl. If it is too dry, add a little water a tbls at a time.

Turn the dough out on a well-floured work surface, sprinkle the top
with a little additional flour. Knead until it become very springy,
elastic and very smooth. It should be light in weight, if it is
heavy, you have use too much flour and it will not raise properly.
Form into a smooth ball and let rest on the work surface while you
wash and clean the large bowl. Spray with a non-stick spray. Put the
ball of dough into the bowl and turn it over to get some of the spray
on the top. Cover with plastic wrap or a warm, damp, clean dishtowel.
Let the dough rise in a warm, draft free place until double in
volume, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

If the dough rises before you are ready, punch it down in the bowl by
kneading making sure all of the air is gone. Turn it over and reshape
it into a ball and let rise again. If the top is dry, use a little
olive oil to grease it.  You can punch the dough down and cover the
bowl and keep the dough refrigerated for up to two days before
letting it rise at room temperature.

For a thin, crisp pizza crust punch the dough down and turn out and
spread over a pizza pan or baking sheet or a bakers peel. Cover with
filling and topping, baking at once.

For thicker, softer pizza crust punch the dough down and turn out
shaping as above and then cover lightly with a clean dishtowel. Let
rise about 30 minutes before covering with filling and topping.

Makes enough dough for one 12 to 14 inch round pizza, two 7 to 8-
inch round pizzas or one oblong pizza, or one dozen appetizer-sized
pizzas.

True Garlic Bread

breads, garlic

1 single garlic puree(2 roasted head)
1/4 lb unsalted butter, softened
2 tablespoon (2 pk) dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (115-120 degrees)
2 1/2 cup warm water
2 tablespoon kosher salt
3 1/4 cup whole wheat flour
3 1/4 cup unbleached all purpose flour
1 single cornmeal

Cream together the garlic puree and butter.  (This may be done days in
advance and refrigerated.  Bring to room temperature before using).
Combine the yeast with 1/2 cup warm water in large bowl.  Stir with a
fork or small whisk.  Add an additional 2 1/2 cups water.  Add salt.
Stir in the flour, 1 c at a time, beginning with the whole wheat.
Use a whisk until the dough becomes stiff, then switch to a wooden
spoon.  Turn the dough onto a well floured work surface.  Knead
rhythmically for 10 to 15 minutes, until the dough is smooth,
springy, nonsticky, and elastic.  Add more flour as you knead if
necessary.  The dough is ready if you can poke to fingers into it and
the resulting indentations spring back.  Cover the dough with a cloth
and let rest while you wash, dry and generously butter the bowl.
Knead the dough a few more turns, then form it into a ball and place
it in the bowl.  Turn it to coat with butter.  Cover the bowl and put
it in a warm, draft-free place until the dough has doubled in bulk,
about 1 1/2 hours.  It has risen sufficiently when you can gently
poke a finger into the dough and the hole reamins.  (Don't poke too
enthusiastically or the dough will collapse.)  When doubled, flour
your fist and punch the dough down.  Knead it a few times and then
let it rest. Sprinkle 1 large or 2 small baking sheets with a liberal
amount of cornmeal.  Divide the dough into 3 equal parts.  While you
work with 1 piece, keep the other 2 covered.  Flour your work
surface.  With a rolling pin, roll each piece of dough into a
rectangle approximately 14-inches long X 7-inches wide.  Spread it
with softened garlic butter.  Roll the long edge toward the opposite
long edge, as if you were rolling up a rug. Pinch ends closed.  Place
loves on the baking sheets.  With a sharp knife or razor blade, slash
the loves lightly at 2-inch intervals.  Cover with a cloth and place
in a warm draft-free place to rise until doubled, about 1/2 hour.
Meanwhile preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Bake for 35 to 40 minutes
with a pan of boiling water on the oven floor.  Spray loaves with
water several times during the baking process.  (This helps the bread
form a thick crusty shell.)  To test for doneness, rap the loaf with
your knuckles.  The loaf should sound hollow.  Cool on wire racks,
but the loaves are delicious eaten warm right out of the oven.

Truly Yeast Bread (Gluten Free)

breads

3 cup gf flour mix (recipe follows)
1/4 cup sugar
3 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum
2/3 cup dry milk powder
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 cup lukewarm water
1 1/2  yeast cakes, or 1 1/2 tablespoons y; east granules
1/4 cup shortening
1 1/4 cup water
1 teaspoon vinegar
3  eggs

Combine flour, sugar, xanthan gum, milk powder, and salt in bowl of
heavy duty mixer.  Use your strongest beaters. Dissolve the 2
teaspoons of sugar in the 1/2 cup of lukewarm water and mix in the
yeast. Set aside while you combine the shortening and 1 1/4 cups
water in saucepan and heat until shortening melts. Turn mixer on low.
Blend dry ingredients and slowly add shortening and water mixture and
the vinegar.  Blend, then add the eggs. This mixture should feel
slightly warm. Pour the yeast mixture into the ingredients in the
bowl and beat at highest speed for 2 minutes. Place mixing bowl in a
warm place, cover with plastic wrap and a towel, and let the dough
rise approximately 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until doubled. Return to mixer
and beat on high for 3 minutes. Spoon the dough into 3 small (2 1/2"
x 5") greased loaf pans or 1 large one. Use muffin tins and bake any
remaining as small rolls. Or make all rolls (approximately 18). Let
rise until the dough is slightly above the top of pan. Bake in
preheated 400 degree oven for 10 minutes. Place foil over bread and
bake large loaves 50 minutes longer, small loaves slightly less time,
and rolls about 25 minutes. NOTES:  The dough texture will seem more
like cookie dough than bread dough, so don't be alarmed. Bread is
better

Tsoureki (Easter Bread)

breads, greek, middle east

2 pkg active dry yeast
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup milk; lukewarm (110-115 deg)
2 1/2 cup all purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
2  egg
8 tablespoon butter, unsalted; cut into
1  ; small bits
1 tablespoon butter; softened
1 teaspoon lemon peel; finely grated
1  egg; hard boiled, in the
1  ; shell, dyed red with food
1  ; coloring
1  egg yolk; lightly beaten
      ----SILVER XPRESS MAIL SYSTEM 5----

In a small, shallow bowl, sprinkle the yeast and the 1/2 teaspoon of
sugar over the lukewarm milk.  Let it stand for 2 or 3 minutes, then
stir to dissolve the yeast completely. Set the bowl in a warm, draft
free place (such as an unlighted oven) for 8 to 10 minutes, or until
the mixture doubles in volume.
Combine 1 1/2 cups of flour, the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar, and
the salt in a deep mixing bowl.  Make a well in the center, and add
the yeast and the 2 eggs. Gently stir the center ingredients together
with a large spoon, then gradually incorporate the flour and continue
beating until all the ingredients are well combined. beat in the 8
tablespoons of butter and lemon peel, add up to 1 cup more flour,
beating it n a few tablespoons at a time and using as much as
necessary to from a dough that can be gathered into a soft and still
somewhat sticky ball. (When the dough becomes difficult to stir
easily, work in the flour with your fingers.)
Place the dough on a lightly floured surface, and knead it by
pressing it down, pushing it forward several times with the heel of
your hand, and folding it back on itself. Repeat for about 10
minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic.  sprinkle the
dough with a little extra flour from time to time to prevent it from
sticking to the board.
Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a large, lightly
buttered bowl.  Dust the top with a little flour, drape with a
kitchen towel and set aside in a warm, draft free place for about 1
hour until the dough doubles in bulk.
With a pastry brush, coat a baking sheet with the tablespoon of
softened butter.  Punch the dough down with a single blow of your
fist, then transfer it to a lightly floured surface. To shape the
dough into a snail like loaf, roll it into a thick rope about 2
inches in diameter and 24 inches long.  Starting at one end, loop the
rope into a circle about 6 inches in diameter, and then into ever
smaller concentric circles. Carefully transfer the loaf to the baking
sheet and let it rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F).  Press the dyed egg gently
into the center and brush the top of the loaf with the beaten egg
yolk. Bake in the middle of the oven for about 45 minutes, or until
golden brown and crusty. Cool completely on a cake rack before
serving.

Tuscan Bread

breads, italian

1 oz fresh yeast; -=or=- instant dry yeast
1 1/4 cup warm water (125f)
2 1/4 cup unbleached white flour
1/4 cup whole wheat flour

IN A LARGE BOWL, DISSOLVE the yeast in the water. Mix the 2 flours
and stir them in to make a soft dough. Knead 10 minutes by hand, or 4
minutes in a heavy duty mixer with a dough hook. Oil a clean bowl and
set the dough in it, cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise
until doubled in bulk. (In the traditional warm place, this will take
about 2 hours. However, a cooler temperature will do as long as the
dough has enough time to rise, including overnight in the
refrigerator.) If the dough is ready sooner than it is needed, punch
it down and refrigerate it or let it rise slowly again at room
temperature until ready to use. Rub 2 to 3 tablespoons flour into a
lintless dish towel and set the towel on a baking sheet. When the
dough has completed its rising, punch it down, turn it out onto a
floured work surface, and flatten it into an oblong about 8 inches
wide, 10 inches long, and 1/4-inch thick. It will still be very soft,
but try to use a minimum of additional flour in handling it. Roll the
dough tight, jelly-roll fashion, into a cylindrical shape. Flatten
this to about 1-inch thick and roll it again. (This activates the web
of gluten that will keep the loaf from flattening out in the oven.)
FOR A ROUND LOAF, tuck both ends of the cylinder under to meet in the
center, pinching to seal them. Roll the dough around the work surface
under your hands, to shape it into a smooth ball about 5 inches in
diameter. FOR AN OBLONG LOAF, roll the dough under your hands into a
fat cigar shape, extending it to about 10 inches in length. Set the
loaf on the floured towel and fold the ends of the towel loosely
around it. Put the covered loaf, on its baking sheet, in a warm place
to rise for 1 hour. Preheat an oven lined with baking tiles to 400F.
Have a water-filled sprayer handy. Slide your hand under the towel,
pick up the loaf, and gently deposit it upside down on the tiles.
Spray water into the oven before closing the door, and spray twice
more at 2-minute intervals. Bake for 50 minutes or until golden
brown. The bread should have a hollow sound when you knock on its
bottom. Makes 1 Loaf

made in Thrace, the soft-dough may be spread into a sheet and cut in
squares before baking, or each shaped individually into daintly
"bastounakia" (little canes or sticks).   The word "trifti"
identifies the texture - crisp and crumbly in the mouth. (They are
also called "kourou" [cut small].) If making the individual "little
canes," they should be half a (dainty) finger wide and a finger in
length. The secret of the crispness is in adding only enough flour to
make a soft dough.

To make about 100 1-inch squares:

The mixing of the dough may be begun with an electric mixer, but
should be finished by hand.  Beat the butter until fluffy, then lower
the speed and add the olive oil. Continue beating, and when fluffy
beat in the milk, baking powder, salt, if necessary, and cheese.
Begin adding flour, but after 1 cup stop beating with the mixer and
beat in the remaining flour by hand, adding only enough to make dough
soft enough to roll into strips. Knead a few minutes.  Spread or roll
on buttered sheet (jelly roll tray, cookie sheet, or any flat pan) to
a thickness of half-finger's width and cut into squares of desired
size (the smaller the better, since they are rich).  Bake in a
moderate oven (350 degrees) for 20 to 25 minutes, moving to the top
shelf for the last minutes to achieve a golden chestnut color. (If
making the "little canes," the baking time will be 10 to 12 minutes.)
Remove when done and cook on a rack.

Note: Stored in covered tins, these will keep for several weeks.

Ukrainian Almond Crescents

breads, desserts

2 cup to 2 1/2 c unbleached white flour
1 pkg dry yeast (about 1 tbs)
1 cup sweet butter, room temp
2  egg yolks, beaten
3/4 cup sour cream
1  filling:
2 cup almonds, toasted and coarsley groun; d
2/3 cup to 3/4 c brown sugar, firmly packed
2  egg whites
1 pinch of salt

From "Sundays at Moosewood Restaurant." Yields 24 pastries

Rogaliki, which means  "little horns," are a specialty of the southern
Ukraine.  They are flaky pastries stuffed with sugar and nuts, and I
warn you, they can be addictive. Although I am seldom interested in
sweets, these are "devilish horns," tempting even me to eat just one
more!

Pastry:

For the pastry, mix together the flour and yeast in a med bowl. Cut
in the butter with a pastry fork until the mixture resembles coarse
meal. Stir in the egg yolks and sour cream and mix well. The mixture
will still be crumbly.  Form the dough into a ball using your hands,
working it as little as possible.  The less you knead, the more
tender the pastry will be. The dough will be tacky.  Wrap it in waxed
paper and chill it for at least 2 hours.

Prepare the filling by combining the ground almonds and sugar in a
small bowl.  Beat together the egg whites and salt until stiff, but
not dry, and carefully fold them into the nut mixture.

Preheat the oven to 375F.  When the dough is thoroughly chilled,
divide it into three balls.  Using a floured rolling pin, roll out
three circles about 1/8" thick. Work on a well-floured surface to
prevent the dough from sticking.  Cut each circle into eight
pie-shaped wedges and spread the wedges with the filling. Starting at
the wide end, roll each wedge up like a little croissant and then
pull the ends into a curve to form a "horn." Make sure the point is
on the bottom so the "horns" will not open up while baking.

Place the almond crescents on a lightly oiled baking sheet and bake
for about 30 - 40 min, until golden and puffed.

Ukrainian Black Bread

breads

      ----YIELD: 1 LOAF----
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1/4 cup ; water, warm (not hot!)
1 cup coffee, strong; cooled
1 teaspoon blackstrap molasses
3 cup whole rye flour
1/2 cup whole buckwheat flour
1 1/4 teaspoon salt

Dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water. Stir the molasses into the
coffee. Combine the dry ingredients. Mix in the wet ones and knead the
dough for 10-12 minutes. Cover the dough at this point in a bowl and
allow to sit for 2 hours. Take it out and knead again for 3-4
minutes. Shape into a round ball and and cover it for 30 minutes
more. Take the ball between your hands and roll it into a long thin
shape akin to the of a French bread loaf, approximately 2-3 inches in
diameter. Be sure to keep your hands wet when handling the dough at
all stages thus far. Grease a cookie sheet and place the dough upon
it. Proof the dough in a warm oven (about 85 degree F.) for 45
minutes. Bake in a 375 degree F moist oven (place 1 cup of water in a
metal bowl in the oven) for 20 minutes. Remove the water bowl and
continue to bake for 30 minutes more at 375 degrees F. This makes one
long loaf or it may be made into 2 shorter loaves or even into rolls.

Valentine Cookies

biscuits

1  stephen ceidebuurg
3/4 cup margarine or butter, softened
3/4 cup honey
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
2 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup finely chopped almonds

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.

In a large bowl, beat margarine, honey and almond extract with an
electric mixer until mixture is light and fluffy. Add flour, 1 cup at
a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in almonds. On
ungreased cookie sheets, shape 1/2-cup portions of dough into heart
shapes, no more than 1/2-inch thick. Decorate as desired by following
one of the tips below or by using a tooth-pick, fork or other kitchen
tool to create a design. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until edges turn
brown. Cool 5 minutes and remove from pan.

Decorating tips:

You can create a design on top of the cookies using white or colored
candy sprinkles.

Or you could crimp the edges of heart, making a design using the
tines of fork, or a knife, spatula or spoon. Sprinkle baked cookies
with powdered sugar.

If you are an experienced baker, you may want to paint a design with a
simple egg-yolk paint. Separate an egg; put the egg yolk in a small
bowl and mix with 1/2 teaspoon water and enough red food coloring to
make the desired sired shade of red. Using a clean paint brush, paint
a design on cookie using the colored yolk. Or place a small doily on
cookie and, using a clean, stiff brush, work the egg paint through
the cutouts and create a lacy effect. Remember that this is all done
before the cookies are baked.

Makes 4 large cookies.

Varenyky (Filled Dumplings)

breads, soups, holiday, ethnic, russian

5 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon butter
1 cup evaporated milk
1/2 cup water as needed

* Do not use Condensed milk in this recipe

Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl, forming a well in the
middle. Add the butter and milk and mix lightly until the flour is
absorbed. (Add a little warm water as needed.) Knead until the dough
sticks together, cover and allow to rest for a few minutes, then
knead until smooth. Cover and set aside. Place the dough in a lightly
oiled bowl, turn, and cover for about 1/2 . Place 1/4 of the dough on
a floured work surface, re-covering the rest of the dough.  Roll into
a circle, starting at the center and rolling outwards to maintain an
even thickness, turn over and from the center, roll the dough out to
about 1/8-inch thickness. Run a hand under the bottom to loosen it.
With a 3" biscuit cutter or a glass, cut into rounds. When done
cutting, place 1 T of the filling on one side of each, flipping the
other half over the top and sealing with your fingers or a fork. Be
sure to seal these well. Place each of the dumplings on a floured
cooky sheet, keeping the dumplings covered with a towel. Repeat with
the remaining dough, saving the scraps until last. Use as little
flour as possible in this process or the scraps will be come tough
and heavy. Gently drop 12 to 15 varenyky into 3 quarts of boiling
water, in a large Dutch oven. Do not overcrowd. Stir and cook for
about 3 - 4 minutes. Drain in a collander and place on a lightly
oiled cookies sheet, shaking to coat with a thin film to prevent
sticking. Do not pile the dumplings on top of each other. If the
varenyky are to be frozen, remove with a slotted spoon when they
float to the top. DO NOT overcook. To freeze. Place in the freezer on
an oiled cookie sheet when they are at room temp.. When they are
frozen hard, store in tightly sealed plastic bags. Varenyky may be
poached, pan-fried or steamed, served as an accompaniment with meats,
or served with sour cream, chopped sauteed onions, plain yogurt,
bacon or sausages.

Vasilopita ( New Year Bread)

breads, greek

1 pkg active dry yeast
3/4 cup milk; lukewarm
3  eggs; beaten
1 1/2 teaspoon grated orange rind
3/4 cup caster sugar
4 1/2 cup plain flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground masticha
1/2 cup butter; melted
1  egg; for glazing
1  blanched split almonds

New Year Bread is traditionally cut at midnight on New Year's Eve.
After baking, a coin is inserted through a slit in the base.  The
person who finds the coin will have luck in the New Year.  Long ago
the coin used to be a gold one, then later a silver coin was used.
These could be incorporated into the dough before baking.  Nowadays
because of the nickel content of coins it is undesirable to bake a
coin in the cake.

Dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup of the milk.  Add remainder of milk, eggs,
orange rind and sugar.  Sift 3 cups flour, salt and spice into a warm
bowl and make a well in the centre.  Pour in yeast mixture and stir
to blend in flour, gradually adding warm melted butter.  Mix dough
with hands until it comes away from sides.  Turn on to a floured
surface and knead until smooth and elastic, adding remaining flour as
required.  Knead for 10 minutes. Place ball of dough in a clean bowl
brushed with melted butter. Turn dough over to coat top with butter
and cover bowl with a cloth or plastic wrap. Leav to prove (rise) in
a warm place until doubled in bulk. Punch down and turn on to lightly
floured surface.  Knead lightly and shape into a round loaf.  Place
on a large greased baking sheet or in a greased 25 cm (10 inch) deep
cake tin.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled - about 1
1/2 to 2 hours.

Glaze with well-beaten egg and arrange blanched almonds in numbers to
denote the New Year, pressing in lightly.  Bake in a moderately hot
oven for 45 minutes until golden brown and cooked when tested.  If
bread browns too quickly place a piece of greased brown paper on top.
Cool on a wire rack.

New Year Bread is traditionally cut at midnight on New Year's Eve.
After baking, a coin is inserted through a slit in the base. The
person who finds the coin will have luck in the New Year. Long ago
the coin used to be a gold one, then later a silver coin was used.
These could be incorporated into the dough before baking. Nowadays
because of the nickel content of coins it is undesirable to bake a
coin in the cake.

Dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup of the milk.  Add remainder of milk, eggs,
orange rind and sugar.  Sift 3 cups flour, salt and spice into a warm
bowl and make a well in the centre. Pour in yeast mixture and stir to
blend in flour, gradually adding warm melted butter. Mix dough with
hands until it comes away from sides. Turn on to a floured surface
and knead until smooth and elastic, adding remaining flour as
required. Knead for 10 minutes. Place ball of dough in a clean bowl
brushed with melted butter. Turn dough over to coat top with butter
and cover bowl with a cloth or plastic wrap. Leav to prove (rise) in
a warm place until doubled in bulk. Punch down and turn on to lightly
floured surface. Knead lightly and shape into a round loaf.  Place on
a large greased baking sheet or in a greased 25 cm (10 inch) deep
cake tin.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled - about 1
1/2 to 2 hours.

Glaze with well-beaten egg and arrange blanched almonds in numbers to
denote the New Year, pressing in lightly. Bake in a moderately hot
oven for 45 minutes until golden brown and cooked when tested. If
bread browns too quickly place a piece of greased brown paper on top.
Cool on a wire rack.

Vegetable Finger Salad

appetizers, breads, vegetables

2 pkg pillsbury crescent rolls
2 pkg cream cheese - 8 oz. each
1 cup mayonnaise
1 pkg hidden valley ranch dressing
1  mix (original recipe - dry)
1/2 cup chopped green pepper
1/2 cup chopped carrots
1/2 cup chopped broccoli
1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese

Press out in one piece without separation 2 packages Pillsbury
Crescent Rolls in jelly roll pan or cookie sheet with edge (2 pans).
Bake as directed on Crescent Roll package and cool.

Mix together cream cheese, mayonnaise and Hidden Valley Ranch
Dressing. Spread on cooled baked roll mix.

Mix together chopped vegetables and press into cream cheese mixture.

Refrigerate.  Cut into small squares.  Will keep several days in
refrigerator.

Personal Note:  This recipe makes a LOT.  I cut all ingredients in
half and still have plenty to serve (in addition to other snack
foods). I also replace half the mayo with non-fat yogert, and replace
the cheddar cheese with a fourth vegetable to cut the fat content
(Still tastes delicious).

The total servings will change depending on how large or small you
cut each piece.  I only listed 24 because Meal Master requires a
number. Please change once you make the recipe and count the pieces.
Thanks.

Vegetable-Flecked Semolina Crackers

breads, snacks, crackers

1/3 cup shredded carrot
2 tablespoon minced onions
2 tablespoon minced dried mushrooms
1 tablespoon minced sundried tomatoes (no
2 teaspoon dried basil
2 tablespoon freshly grated parmesan chee
1 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon water
2 tablespoon olive oil
2/3 cup unbleached flour
2/3 cup semolina flour

Preheat the oven to 250F.  Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.
Spread the carrot over the paper; top with the onion. Bake for about
30 minutes to dry out the vegetables. Cool on the baking sheet on a
wire rack. Reduce oven temperature to 350F.  In a large bowl, combine
the dried carrots and onion with the mushrooms, tomatoes, and basil.
Add the unbleached and semolina flours, the cheese, baking powder,
and salt; mix well with a fork. Make a well in the center.  Add the
water and oil. Mix with a wooden spoon until the dough begins o
gather. (If the dough is slightly dry add another tablespoon of
water.) Knead with hands into a ball. Roll the dough between the
palms of hands into a thick rope. Wrap in waxed paper and chill for
15 minutes. After the dough has chilled, cut it into 12 equal pieces.
Working with one piece at a time (keep the remaining dough covered),
shape into a ball. Place the ball of dough between two pieces of
lightly- floured waxed paper and roll out to a 4 to 5 inch circle.
Remove the waxed paper and place the circle on a large baking sheet.
Repeat with the rest of the dough.  The crackers can touch as they do
not spread during baking. Bake for 15 minutes at 350F, or until
lightly golden but not brown. Cool on wire racks. Store in an
airtight container. These big, thin, golden wafers are streaked with
vegetable pieces. Makes 12 crackers.

Vienna Christmas Stollen

breads

1 1/2 cup milk; scald/cool to lukewarm
3 1/2  yeast; dry/envelopes
3/4 cup water; lukewarm
3 cup flour; sifted
1/2 cup eggs; yolks/lightly beaten
3/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoon salt
1 cup flour
1/2 cup butter; softened
1  flour; 10-11 c. as needed
5 cup sultanas; (currants)
1 1/2 cup almonds; chopped or slivered
1 cup citron; chopped
1/2  lemon; rind only/grated
2 teaspoon rum

Milk should be cooled to about 100 degrees. Dissolve the yeast in the
lukewarm water and add 1/4 c. of the cooled milk and 3 c. sifted
flour. Cover the sponge with a cloth and let it ripen until bubbles
appear on the surface and it is about to drop in the center. Pour the
remaining milk over the sponge. Add the egg yolks, sugar and salt and
beat until the ingredients are well blended. Add 1 cup flour and beat
well. Blend in the butter. Add more flour gradually to make a smooth
dough, or until 10 to 11 cups have been added. Some flours absorb
more liquid than others. Knead in the sultanas, almonds, and citron,
along with the lemon rind which should be mixed with the rum. Knead
the dough until the fruits and nuts are dispersed well through it and
it is smooth. Dust the top lightly with flour and let it rise in a
warm place about 45 minutes. Punch it down and let stand for 20
minutes. Divide the dough in half and knead the pieces until smooth.
Let them stand for 10 minutes longer. Place one ball of dough on a
lightly floured board, and with a rolling pin, press down the center
of the ball, and roll the pin to and fro 4 to 5 times, pressing all
the time to make an elliptical shape 6 inches long and 3 1/2" wide.
The center rolled part should be 1/8" thick and 4 inches long. Both
ends should remain untouched, resembling rather thick lips. Place
this rolled out piece of dough on a buttered baking sheet and brush
the center part with melted butter. Fold one lip toward the other and
on the top of it. Press the fingertips down near and below the lips,
pulling somewhat apart. Give a pull away from each end, pointing them
toward the lips. The shape should resemble a waning moon. Repeat the
process with the second piece of dough. (Unless you have gone
completely crazy by now! note: my comment, not Gourmet's). Let the
Stollen rise, covered in a warm place until they double in bulk,
about 1 1/2 hours. Bake them in a moderately hot oven (375 degrees)
for 35 to 40 minutes. Do not overbake them. Cool them on racks. Brush
them with butter and cover with vanilla sugar. Recipe will be posted

Vix Vivax--Romulan Raisin/Walnut Bread

breads

4 cup milk
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup sugar
2 tablespoon light molasses
2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup sour cream
2 pkg dry yeast
13 cup flour (more or less)
2 cup golden raisins
2 cup walnuts; coarsely chopped
1  egg; for glaze

***This makes 4 loaves of bread Scald the milk. Add the butter, sugar,
molasses and salt. Let it cool for about 10 minutes and add the sour
cream, beating with a wire whisk to mix it all thoroughly. Pour it
into a large bowl. When the liquid is cool enough so that a drop on
the inside of your wrist is not hot enough to hurt, add the yeast.
(if you add yeast to the hot mixture, you will kill the yeast and the
bread will not rise.) Add about 5 cups of flour, 1 cup at a time, and
mix it well with the liquid, breaking up lumps as you mix. Add
raisins and walnuts. Add flour, 1 cup at a time, until the dough is
no longer very sticky; it should be right when you have added about
12 cups. Sprinkle out about 1/4 to 1/2 cup flour onto a clean board
or countertop. Dump the dough onto the floury place and scrape out
the bowl onto the dough. Wash, dry and grease the bowl. Now, knead
the dough for about 15 to 20 minutes using up the last of the flour.
It should feel stretchy and elastic. Put the dough into the greased
bowl and grease the top. Cover it will a damp cloth and set it in a
warm place to rise. It may take as much as 2 hours until it is double
in bulk. When it has doubled in bulk, flour a place on the counter,
dump it out and knead it again for about 5 minutes. Divide the dough
into 4 equal parts and grease 4 bread pans. Shape the dough into
loaves and put 1 in each pan. Cover the pans with a damp cloth and
let the dough rise until about double in bulk, about 1 hour. Preheat
the oven to 325 degrees, brush the tops of the loaves with beaten
egg, and put them in the oven. Bake at 325 for 30 minutes and then at
300 degrees for another 30 minutes. The loaves will sound "hollow"
when tapped when they are done. Take them out of the oven as soon as
they are done. Turn them out of the pan onto cake racks. The bread is
best served warm, but it may be cooled and then frozen to save.

Vushka (Little Ear Dumplings)

breads, christmas, russian

2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 large egg yolk
1/2 cup evaporated milk; or
1/2 cup whole milk
1 teaspoon oil or mrlted butter

Combine the flour and salt, blending well.  Add the milk, egg yolk,
and oil, again blending well.  Allow to rest for 5 minutes. Knead for
about minutes and form into a ball. (This may be done in a
processor.) Cover and set aside for 15 minutes or so.  On a floured
surface, roll out a third of the dough, into a rectangle 1/8th inch
thick. Turn the dough and roll from the center, so that all the dough
in the rectangle is even in thickness. Run a hand under the dough to
loosen it. Dust with flour and flip over and dust with flour.  With a
sharp knife, cut into 1 1/2-inch squares. Place a teaspoon of
mushroom filling (see the next recipe in this series) in each square,
being careful not to smear the edges.  Fold on the diagonal to make a
triangle.  Pinch together the two bottom corners, wrapping it around
your thumb with the point up (to resemble small ears on a cat),
making sure that the edges have bonded or the stuffing will boil out.
Place on cookie sheets covered with dish towels lightly dusted with
flour. Repeat with the other pieces of dough, saving the scraps for
last as the dough gets a little tougher when worked.  Drop 10 or 12
vushka into 6 to 8 cups of rapidly boiling water and stir once with a
wooden spoon, (The wooden spoon is very important as a metal one will
lower the temperature of the water.) Do NOT cover.  When they float
to the top, cook 1 minut, then remove with a slotted spoon to a
strainer. Cool on a lightly oiled plate without crowding.  Repeat
until all are cooked. Cover and set aside. These may be frozen and
then reheated in boiling water. (DO NOT overcook when reheating.)

TO SERVE:

Place 4 or 5 vushka in soup plates and pour hot borsch over them.

Waffles - History

breads, breakfast

1  text

Waffles are as American as apple pie, and like apple pie are an
import. The word "waffle" and probably the food, comes to us from the
Dutch "wafel", but the French eat them too, calling them "gaufre"
from the Old French "wafla".  Whatever their provenance, waffles have
been eaten by Americans since Pilgrim times.

Europeans eat their waffles as a sweet course, topping them with
powdered sugar, whipped cream, or honey or stuffing them with icing.
Americans have occasionally served waffles for dessert - perhaps a
chocolate waffle with ice cream - but in general we eat them for
breakfast with all-American maple syrup.  At least NOW we do, if we
eat waffles at all.

But in the Thirties, and before that, Americans ate waffles with
virtually anything that could be spooned or poured over their bumpy,
golden tops. And we ate them for breakfast, for luncheon, and for
supper. If we served them to guests at a Sunday Night Supper, it
became a waffle supper, "sure to be a party guests remember,"
according to the General Foods cookbook "All About Home Baking"
(1933).

And we made waffles with just about everything: Cheese waffles;
cornmeal waffles; coconut, pineapple, and chocolate waffles;
gingerbread waffles; banana waffles; cheese and tomato, date, and
peanut butter waffles; apple waffles; oatmeal waffles; and prune,
bran, apricot, and even pea pulp waffles (which Pictorial Review
featured as one of their best recipes for 1927.)

Waffles Using Pancake & Waffle Mix  (Mm#23)

breads

2  eggs
1 1/4 cup milk
2 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
1  bag pancake & waffle mix

Preheat waffle iron.

Separate eggs, putting whites into small bowl and yolks into mixing
bowl. With rotary beater or whisk, beat the whites until they form
firm peaks. With the same beater beat the yolks until they are well
mixed, then beat in milk and the melted butter.

Stir the mix into the liquid ingredients, blending it in just until
the dry ingredients are moistened (don't try to make smooth batter).
Fold in egg whites.

Bake the waffles in the preheated iron according to manufacturer's
directions for heat settings, etc. When no more steam rises from
edges of iron, open and check for doneness. Bake a little longer if
it isn't done to suit you.

If waffles are to be frozen for future reheating in toaster, bake only
until light gold.  Cool on racks and wrap airtight for freezer
storage.

Walnut Beer Bread

breads

1 1/2 cup warm beer
2 pkg active dry yeast
4 1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour - or a; s needed
1/2 cup rye flour
2 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon salt
1/2 cup walnut oil
1 cup finely chopped yellow onion
3/4 cup coarsely chopped walnuts
1  egg
2 teaspoon ; water
1  fresh or dried rosemary

Heat the beer to 105 to 115 F. and pour 1/2 cup into a small bowl.
Stir in the yeast and let stand 10 minutes.

Mix the flours, sugar and salt in a large bowl.  Make a well in the
center. Pour the yeast mixture, oil and remaining 1 cup beer into the
well and stir until blended.

Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 10
minutes, adding more flour if necessary.

Coat a large bowl with walnut oil.  Place the dough in the bowl and
turn to coat with oil.  Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a
warm place until doubled in bulk.  (You can also let the dough rise
overnight in a cool place or in the refrigerator.)

Punch dough down and knead in the onion and walnuts until evenly
distributed throughout the dough.

Divide dough in half.  Divide each half into thirds.  Using your
hands, roll each of the pieces into 12" long ropes.  Braid 3 ropes
together to form a loaf.  Tuck the ends under and place on an 18 x
12" baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough, placing it on the same
baking sheet. Cover and let rise until doubled in bulk, 45 minutes to
1 hour.

Beat the egg and 2 tsp. water in a small bowl.  Brush the tops of the
loaves with the egg wash and sprinkle with rosemary.  Bake at 375 F.
until crusty and brown, 45 to 50 minutes.  Cool in the pans for 10
minutes. Turn out onto wire racks and cool completely.

The authors write: "A hearty and rustic bread that makes an excellent
picnic lunch with cheese, especially goat's milk cheese.  Take your
favorite full-bodied red wine along."

Walnut Honey Bread

breads

1 1/2 cup walnuts -- coarsely chopped
1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 cup water -- 105-115 degrees
2 tablespoon water -- 105-115 degrees
3/4 cup basic bread sponge
5 tablespoon honey
1 1/2 tablespoon walnut oil
2 3/4 cup all-purpose flour --
1  unbleached
1/2 cup all-purpose flour -- for
1  kneading
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1  cornmeal -- for sprinkling

Try using maple syrup instead of honey.

Can use olive oil instead of walnut.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Place the walnuts on a baking sheet,
roasting until fragrant and golden brown, about eight minutes. Cool.

In a bowl, dissolve  the yeast in the water.  Allow to proof for three
minutes.

Stir the sponge, honey and oil into the water, breaking the sponge up
using your hands or a spoon.

Add 2 3/4 cups of the flour and salt and mix, scraping and folding
until the dough gathers into a single mass. Knead, in the bowl, until
the dough becomes soft and only slightly sticky, using the additional
flour gradually as necessary.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead the nuts
into the dough until they are evenly distributed.

Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and
refrigerate overnight.

Halve the dough and shape each piece into a ball and place on a
flour-dusted kitchen towel.  Cover with plastic wrap and allow to
rise in a draft-free location for two hours.

Sprinkle a baking sheet generously with cornmeal. Gently press one of
the dough balls down on a lightly floured surface and then reshape
into a ball. Do the same with the other risen ball. Place both balls,
with the seams on the bottom, on the baking sheet, cover with plastic
wrap and allow to rise until doubled, in a draft-free location. This
should take 2-3 hours.

Preheat the oven for at least thirty minutes along with a baking
stone or tiles on the middle rack to 425. Place a baking pan with
decent sides on the bottom shelf. Boil two cups of water. Using a
razor blade, make an 'X' in the top of each of the loaves. Pour the
boiling water into the baking pan.   With a quick jerk, slide the
loaves off the sheet and onto the stone.

Bake for 30-35 minutes until the loaves are hollow sounding when
tapped on the bottom.  When done, cool on a rack.

Welsh Cakes

breads, ethnic

1 lb self-raising flour
2 oz butter
4 oz sugar
4 oz sultanas and raisins
2  eggs
1/3 pint water

On sale in every Welsh bakery, these are one of the great delights of
teatime.  The are easy to make.  The Welsh use a flat iron "planc" (a
griddle) to bake the cakes, which are cooked on top heat like Scotch
pancakes.  A heavy frying pan will do fine if you don't have a
griddle. Makes 15-18 cakes.

Rub the fat into the flour and add the fruit and sugar. Mix the water
with the eggs and use to make a soft dough just a little firmer than
that for the scones. Tip on to a well-floured board and roll out to a
thickness of 1/2-inch.  Cut out circles with a 2-1/2-inch shell-edged
cutter.

Heat a planc or heavy iron frying pan - get the heat up into it
gently and thoroughly, and do not let it overheat. If the pan is not
well-seasoned or non-stick, slick it with a little butter or
vegetable oil.

Bake the cakes on the pan, turning them once, until well-risen and
lightly browned.  They will take about 5 minutes each side. Eat hot
or cold, with or without salty butter, but always with a cup of
piping-hot tea.

Welsh Cakes (Bakestone Recipes)

breads

8 oz plain flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon mized spice
2 oz butter or margarine
2 oz lard
3 oz granulated sugar
2 oz raisins (or currants)
1  egg, beaten
3 tablespoon milk

Cut into 3 inch rounds.  Bake on a hot greased bakestone until golden
brown, about 4 minutes on each side. * Variation: "Teisen Dinca" --
Make up the Welsh Cake dough adding 6 oz peeled and grated cooking
apples before adding the egg. Mix to a stiff dough, adding milk if
necessary. Roll out, cut into rounds and cook on the bakestone as for
Welsh Cakes. Serve hot with butter, golden syrup, or honey.

West Coast French Sourdough Bread I

breads

1 cup starter
1 pkg dry yeast
3/4 cup flour
3 cup flour
3/4 cup water
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon soda
1 1/2 cup warm water
2 cup flour
2 teaspoon sugar

About 9:00 in the evening measure out 1 cup starter from the
refrigerator storage jar into mixing bowl (do not use metal or
plastic). Add 3/4 cup water and 3/4 cup flour and beat thoroughly.
Cover bowl tightly with clinging transparent wrap and set in warm
place (80 to 85) overnight.

In the morning about 7:00 beat starter thoroughly. Measure out 1 cup
and return remaining starter to storage jar. In another bowl pour
1-1/2 cups of just warm water, stir in 2 tsp. sugar and sprinkle 1
pkg. yeast on top. Let stand until yeast is dissolved. Add the 1 cup
of reserved starter and 3 cups flour. Beat thoroughly, cover tightly
and let stand in warm place until very light and foamy. This will
take from 1 to
1-1/2    hours.

Sift 2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. soda with 1 cup flour and spread the
remaining 1 cup on the pastry board. Stir the sifted flour mix into
the sponge.  Turn out on board and knead for several minutes using a
little more flour if necessary to make a very stiff dough. Knead
until completely smooth and not sticky so that it can be worked on an
unfloured portion of the board without sticking. Divide in halves and
shape into either round or long narrow loaves. Place on flat baking
sheet, preferably non stick, or lightly grease it or sprinkle corn
meal over the surface. Slip into large plastic bag, supported so that
it will not touch dough (drinking glasses placed at each end of sheet
are fine). Set in warm place for 1 to 1-1/2 hours to rise.

If the dough becomes too light the loaves will spread in baking but
this only makes a more delicious crust. When ready for the oven brush
top of loaves with cold water. Make diagonal slashes across top of
long loaves and five or six radiating from center of round ones with
a sharp single-edge razor blade or scissors. Bake in oven preheated
to 400 degrees with pan of hot water on the floor from 50 to 60
minutes and the crust is as dark as desired. About 10 minutes before
the end of the baking period, brush tops with water again. Remove
from pans and stand on edge to cool, propping them against a heavy
glass jar or similar object.

For the most attractive slices, especially if the loaves have spread a
little to much in baking, cut with a very sharp knife diagonally
across the long loaf and at the same time have the blade slanted from
top to bottom away from the end. This makes the slices about twice as
wide as when cut straight up and down. Cut slices from the round
loaves on the slant also. When ready to seve, to preserve the utterly
delicious taste and crisp, hard crust, re-heat quickly with wrapping
open at one end so that the bread will not become steamy, or spread
slices with butter and place under broiler at high heat for a very
short period until the edges are beginning to brown nicely. This
recipe makes 2 long or 2 large round loaves.

Wheat & Sunflower Seed Bread

breads

2  pkgs active dry yeast
2 1/2 cup warm water
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup non-fat dry milk solids
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup vegetable oil
4 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup sunflower seeds
3 cup bread flour
1  egg white

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Dissolve the yeast in the warm (105
degrees-115 degrees) water in a large bowl. Let stand until the yeast
foams (about 5 minutes). Add the sugar and dry milk. Stir in the
salt, oil, half the whole wheat flour and the sunflower seeds. Beat
until smooth. Stir in the remaining whole wheat flour. Beat in the
bread flour, one cup at a time, until the dough will not readily
absorb any more. Cover. Let stand for 15 minutes. Turn the dough out
onto a lightly floured board. Knead the dough until it feels smooth
and elastic (between 5 and 10 minutes). Clean the bowl and grease
thoroughly. Add the dough to the bowl. Turn the dough so that the
entire outer surface is greased. Cover. Let rise in a warm place
until doubled in bulk. Turn the dough out onto a lightly oiled
surface. Knead lightly to release air bubbles. Divide into equal
parts. Shape into loaves. Place the dough in greased (9" x 5") loaf
pans. Let rise until doubled in bulk. Bake until the loaves are done
(30-35 minutes).

1/4 cup :warm water (approx 105f)
1 pkg dry yeast
1 3/4 cup milk
2 tablespoon butter; softened or
2 tablespoon vegetable shortening or oil
2 tablespoon sugar
2 1/2 teaspoon salt
5 1/2 cup all-purpose flour (or more)

POUR THE WARM WATER over the yeast. Stir well, and let stand to
dissolve. Heat the milk, stirring, to the same temperature as the
yeast, then pour it over the dissolved yeast. Add the butter (or
shortening or oil), sugar, salt and 4 cups of the flour. Beat
vigorously with a large spoon for at least 1 minute. Stir in enough
of the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to make a stiff but not
dry dough. Dust the kneading surface with 1/4 cup of the reserved
flour and turn the dough out onto it, cleaning the bowl completely
with a rubber spatula. Knead the dough for 1 minute, sprinkling extra
flour a little at a time as necessary, then let rest for 10 minutes.
Resume kneading for about 6 to 8 minutes more, or until the dough is
smooth and elastic. Put in a lightly greased bowl, cover and let rest
in a warm place to rise for between 1 and 2 hours. When the dough has
doubled in bulk, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and punch
it down for a minute. Cut dough in half and pat each half into an
oval the approximate length of your bread pan, which should be
lightly greased. Put in the pan, cover with a damp towel and let rise
for another 45 minutes to 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350F and, when
the bread is risen, put it in the oven. Bake for about 40-to-45

White Cloud Inn Baked Nut Loaf

breads, vegetarian

1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup diced celery
1 tablespoon oil
1 cup chopped nuts (walnuts and
1  cashews), finely chopped
1 cup cottage cheese
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup bread crumbs
2  eggs, lightly beaten
1/4 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1 1/4 teaspoon onion powder

"This hearty vegetarian standard takes the place of roast turkey at
White Cloud Inn, in the Pocono Mountains of Penn." Preheat oven to
375. Saute onion and celery in oil. Put all ingredients into a
greased 11-3/4 " x 7-1/2" baking dish and bake until just firm and
slightly brown on top, about 35 to 40 minuets. Serve with you
favorite sauce or gravy. The Inn uses a mushroom sauce, but the dish
is also good with a tomato sauce or onion gravy. Yield: 5 to 6
servings.

White Crackers

breads, quick bread

2 cup flour
1 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoon salt; approximately
2 tablespoon butter; chilled
2/3 cup milk, plus droplets more if needed

Recipe by: The Fannie Farmer Cookbook Preheat oven to 425F. Use
ungreased cookie sheets. Combine flour, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt
in a mixing bowl.  Stir the dry ingredients to blend well. Cut the
butter into small pieces and add the the dry mixture. Using either
your fingertips or a pastry cutter, cut the bits of butter into the
dry mixture until it looks like fine crumbs.  Slowly stir in the
milk, adding enough so the dough pulls away from the sides of the
bowl. Add a few drops more if the dough seems dry -- it should be
soft and pliable, not wet and sticky. Divide the dough in half.
Lightly dust a surface with flour. Roll each half out to a square
approximately 13 x 13 inches and thinner than 1/8 inch. Trim the
uneven edges and lift the dough onto the cookie sheet, or roll over a
rolling pin and unroll onto the cookie sheet. use a sharp knife to
score the dough into 2-inch squares, cutting almost through the
dough. Bake 6-8 minutes, or until the edges are slightly golden.
Remove from the oven and with a large spatula loosen the squares and
turn them over. Return to the oven and bake for another 5-6 minutes,
or until the edges are well browned. remove from the oven and slide
the sheet onto racks to cool. Break the crackrs apart when cool and
store in an airtight container. these will keep for weeks and taste
fresh.

Makes 5-dozen 2-inch crackers.

White-Flour Sourdough Starter

breads

2 cup tepid (80) water
1 pkg yeast
1/2 teaspoon sugar
2 cup flour

Mix the water, sugar and yeast until dissolved.  Beat in the flour
until the batter is smooth.  Pour into a clean 2 qt. jar and cover
with a cloth. Let stand at room temp. for 2 to 3 days or until
starter has a sharp, almost winy odor and is bubbly (it will be full
of lively bubbles after a short time and will continue to bubble,
more sedately, until it is sufficiently sour). Exact times can't be
given, as weather and temp affect the rate of fermentation.
TO USE:  If not used at once, cover the starter with a lid and
refrigerate it.  It will be lively enough to use for about 18 hrs; if
refrigerated longer, "feed" it lightly and let it become bubbly at
room temp - usually letting it stand overnight - before using it.
This tangy batter is the key ingredient of English Muffins and many
other sourdough breads.  This recipe makes 3 cups enough to make a
large batch of muffins, with enough left over to serve as a nucleus
for a future baking.  The starter keeps well in a covered jar in the
refrigerator so long as it is "fed" with a small amount of flour and
an equal amount of water about every 2 weeks - this keeps the yeasts
alive. Or freeze it for indefinite storage.  To revive it, feed it
after it thaws and let it stand at room temperature until bubbly
enough to use. If liquid gathers on the surface of stored starter,
stir it in before adding flour and water. Your starter will be good
so long as it responds to feeding and has a pleasantly odor.  If
neglected, it may develop a pink or greenish tinge and an unpleasant
odor.  If that should happen, start over. To increase a small amount
of leftover starter to a quantity large enough for a baking, add
flour and water in equal quantities, but never exceed the proportion
of a cup of flour to a cup of starter.  Let the mix ferment, lightly
covered, at room temp until very bubbly; then, if you need still more
starter, add more flour and water and ferment again.

Whole Wheat & Oak Bran Bread

breads, quick bread

2  eggs
1/2 cup oil
1 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup molasses
1 1/3 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup flour
3/4 cup oat bran flakes
2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 cup dates; chopped
1 cup walnuts; chopped

Beat together first 5 ingredients until blended. Mix together the
remaining ingredients and add all at once. Beat until blended. Do not
overbeat.
Divide batter between 5 greased mini-loaf pans (6x3x2-inches) and
bake in a 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes, or until a cake
tester, inserted in center, comes out clean.  Allow to cool in pan
for 10 minutes, and then remove from pans and continue cooling on a
rack. Yields: 5 mini-loaves.

Note:  Oat bran can be purchased in most supermarkets or health food
stores.  It comes as "milled" or "stone-ground". The milled is finer
in texture and the stone-ground will produce a slightly coarser
crumb, which adds a little character to this country-style loaf.

Cool, add to yeast mix.  Add wheat flour.  Mix until smooth.
Knead 10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, let rise 1
1/2    hours.

*The remaining directions were implied with the word "etc". I assume
the dough would be punched down, allowed to rest, formed into loaves,
and placed in greased loaf pans before allowing to rise the final
time prior to baking.  I included this one because there is an

Whole Wheat Baguettes

breads

1 pkg active dry yeast
2 tablespoon light or dark brown sugar
1 pinch ground ginger
1 1/4 cup warm water (105-115'f.)
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup bread flour
1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1  cornmeal for dusting baking sheet

In large bowl, dissolve yeast, brown sugar, and ginger in warm water.
Let stand 5 minutes until yeast foams. Add salt and bread flour; beat
well. Stir in whole wheat flour to make a stiff dough. Turn out onto
lightly floured board and kneed 10 minutes or until dough is springy,
smooth and satiny. Wash bowl, grease it, and add dough to bowl; turn
over to grease top. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk,
about
1    hour.

Lightly oil or grease a 14x17" baking sheet and sprinkle with
cornmeal; set aside. Punch down the dough. Divide in half and, on a
lightly floured surface, shape into long loaves, rolling each piece
first into a 5x12" rectangle, then rolling each up along the long
side to make a long, narrow loaf. Pinch ends to seal.

Place loaves, seam side down, on prepared baking sheet. Make 4-5
slashes across each loaf with sharp knife or razor blade. Let rise
until doubled, about 45 minutes. Brush each loaf with water and
sprinkle with whole wheat flour. Bake in a preheated 400'F. oven for
15-20 minutes, until loaves are browned and crisp; remove to a wire
rack to cool completely.

Makes 2 loaves; serve 16.

Dough should be sticky - if runny, add more flour. Put in pans,
smoothing top and making sure dough is pushed into corners. Cover
with hot, wet towel and let rise in warm place. Check bread in about
20 minutes and keep checking to be sure dough doesn't rise over lip
of pan. When dough has risen ALMOST to lip of pan, bake at 450
degrees for about 40 mins. Remove from pan immediately and cool on
rack. Mrs. William W. LaViolette

Whole Wheat Bread (Kh)

breads

1/4 cup warm water (105 for dry
1  yeast, 95f for compressed
1  yeast)
1 pkg yeast, active dry or
1  compressed
1 1/2 cup scalded milk, cooled to 105
1  or 95f
1 cup honey
2 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoon salt
6  to 6 1/2 cups whole wheat
1  flour

Pour water into a bowl; add yeast and stir until dissolved. Add milk,
honey, olive oil, and salt. Stir with a wooden spoon until well
blended. Stir in 4 cups of flour, 1 cup at a hme. Beat until dough is
smooth and elastic. Mix in another cup of flour. The dough will be
very stiff. Measure another cup of flour; sprinkle half of it on a
board. Turn dough onto the board. Knead dough, adding flour to board
until the dough no longer sticks. Continue kneading until dough is
not sticky (about 8 minutes). Put dough into a greased bowl about
three times the size of the dough. Turn dough to grease surface
lightly. Cover bowl with a towel and let rise in a warm place for
about 2 hours, or until double in bulk. Test by inserting a finger
about 1/2 inch into dough. If indentation remains, the dough is ready
to shape. Punch dough down; squeeze out air bubbles and shape into a
smooth ball. Let rise again in warm place for about 30 minutes.
Divide into equal portions for 2 loaves. Form each into a smooth oval
loaf. Let stand covered for 15 minutes. Place the loaves seam side
down in 2 greased 9x5x3-inch loaf pans. Cover with a towel and let
rise in warm place until almost double in bulk (about 1 hour). Bake
at 375F about 30 minutes, or until crust is medium brown. Turn out of
pans at once. Cool on wire racks.

Whole Wheat Bread W/Eggs

breads

6 cup whole wheat bread flour
1 tablespoon salt
2 teaspoon dry yeast (1/4 oz)
1/2 cup water, warm
1/4 cup canola oil
3 tablespoon honey
4 large eggs, plus water to make
1  2 3/4 cups
1 large egg, for glazing

:       Stir the flour and salt together in a bowl and make a well in
the center.
:       Dissolve the yeast in the warm water and set aside to proof
while you mix the other liquids.
:       Break the 4 eggs into a measuring cup and add enough water to
make 2 3/4 cups of liquid. Add the oil and honey and beat until
smooth. Add this mixture and the yeast mixture to the well in the
flour and stir together.
:       Knead the dough until it is silky and supple. The dough
should be soft, but nor flabby. For the very best and highest bread,
an efficient kneader will require about 20 minutes to develop the
dough to its springiest.
:       Form the dough into a ball and place it smooth side up in a
bowl; cover and keep in a warm, draft-free place. After about an hour
and a half, gently poke the center of the dough about 1/2 inch deep
with your finger. If the hole doesn't fill in at all, it is ready for
the next step.
:       Press flat, form into a smooth round, and let the dough rise
once more as before. The second rising will take half as much time as
the first.
:       Keep your eye on the dough, and don't let it go so long that
it sighs when you poke it. Egg-rich doughs like this benefit from a
slightly shorter rising time.
:       After the second rise is done, shape your dough into 3 loaves
and place in your prepared pans. Allow them to rise again until
almost doubled in size. Brush the loaves with an egg wash made of one
egg plus 2 tablespoons of water. Cover the whole exposed surface
carefully, but don't let the egg wash collect in the valleys. Now is
the time to sprinkle the loaves with sesame or poppy seeds if you
like.
:       Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes.
Brush the baked loaves with melted margarine or butter while still in
pans and allow to cool in pans for 3-5 minutes. Then cool on racks.

Whole Wheat Croissants

breads

2 tablespoon yeast
3/4 cup water, warm
1 3/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour
1/2 cup water
1 1/2 tablespoon honey
2 cup butter, 1/2 pieces
1  egg
1 tablespoon water

Combine yeast and warm water, stirring a little to dissolve yeast.
Let sit about 10 minutes.  Add 1/2 of flour; add water and honey;
whisk until smooth.  Cover bowl and let stand 1 1/2 hours.

Combine remaining flour with butter, and flatten butter pieces. Pour
yeast batter into flour mixture; fold together with spatula; just
moisten flour without breaking butter pieces.

Turn dough onto lightly floured surface.  Pat dough down and roll
into a 18" x 12" rectangle; if too sticky, sprinkle with flour. Use a
metal spatula to fold 1/3 of dough toward center; then fold from
other side, 1/3 of dough over first 1/3. Lift folded dough off work
surface, and scrape surface clean. Sprinkle work area with flour and
repeat, rolling and folding 3 more times. Dough must be hard; if not,
freeze for 45 minutes.

Pat dough into rectangle.  Cut into parts, 1 part for each 4
croissants. For instance, for 24 croissants: cut in 1/2 lengthwise,
then cut each half into 3 pieces, for a total of 6 (4x6=24). Work
with one piece at a time, holding others in refrigerator until ready
to use. Roll each piece individually into 5 1/2" x 14" rectangles.
Cut into two 5 1/2" x 7" pieces. Cut each piece diagonally to form 4
triangles; roll from wide end to point. Place on ungreased cookie
sheets. Curve ends to crescent shape.

Beat egg with water; brush croissants with this and set them aside 1
hour. Reglaze with egg/water mixture. Bake at 375 degrees until
puffed and brown. Let cool slightly and serve.

2 1/4 cup durum flour
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1 tablespoon canola oil very warm water

Combine flours and salt in a large mixing bowl.

Mix in oil and water to form a stiff dough, adding more water if
necessary. Remove dough from bowl and knead on a lightly floured
surface until smooth, about
5    minutes.

Return dough to bowl, cover with a towel and set aside in a warm
place for one hour.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 14 equal
portions.  Roll each piece into a ball and cover with a damp towel.

Heat an ungreased griddle or large frying pan over medium heat.
Working with one ball of dough at a time, flatten it, then roll into
a 6" circle, using only enough flour to keep dough from sticking.
When griddle is hot, pick up dough, shake off excess flour and place
it on a hot pan. Cook until brown spots appear, about one minute.
Flip dough over and cook on other side.  (Chapati may puff up while
cooking.)

Cover and place in a warm oven while cooking remaining chapatis.

Whole Wheat French Bread

breads, french

1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon lite salt
2 1/2 cup lukewarm water
3 cup white flour
2 cup whole wheat flour(or 3)
1 each egg white+1 t cold water

Combine yeast, sugar,lite salt and water in a large bowl. Gradually
add the flours and mix well(hands work best). At first the dough will
be very sticky; add enough flour to transfer it to a lightly floured
board. Knead until the dough is no longer sticky(about 10 minutes),
adding more flour as necessary. Place in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover
with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in
volume(1 1/2-2 hours). Punch dough down. Transfer to a floured board
and cut into four equal parts. Roll and shape each part into a long
loaf. Place loaves into a lightly oiled, special long-loaf
pans(baguette pans). Slash the top of each loaf diagonally in three
or four places and brush with egg white and water mixture. Let dough
rise another hour or until doubled in volume. Preheat oven to 350
degrees. Bake the loaves until browned and hollow-sounding when
thumped, about 25 minutes.* Halfway through baking, it may be
necessary to cover the loaves with foil to prevent scorching the
tops. Let cool on rack. Makes 4 loaves, about 18 inches long. * If
planning to freeze bread, underbake,i.e., bake in oven only 15
minutes. Wrap in foil when cool.Freeze. When ready to serve remove
from freezer. Leave wrapped in foil. Place in 350 degree oven for 10
minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake for 5 minutes, until crisp.

2 tablespoon oil
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1  eggs
2 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup milk, sour
1/2 cup raisins; chopped (opt)

Preheat oven to 425.  Mix all dry ingredients thoroughly (do not
sift); add shortening, egg, and sour milk. Beat only until smooth.
Fill well-oiled muffin tins 2/3 full.  Bake about 25 minutes.

If sour cream is used, omit 1/2 shortening.

Sylvia's comments: the batter was too liquidy, and the baking times
were too long.  I'll use 1/4 c less liquid next time. They were done
after 20 minutes. They also stuck to the paper liners, so need more
oil.

Whole Wheat Sesame Crackers

appetizers, breads, vegetables, snacks

6 tablespoon sesame seeds; plus...
1/2 cup sesame seeds
1 cup water
3 tablespoon canola or safflower oil
1 teaspoon fine sea salt
2 1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 teaspoon nonaluminum baking powder

Surprise your family or guests with freshly baked crackers. For
special occasions, use cookie cutters to make them into imaginative
shapes. Serve them with a dip for an appetizer or pack them in a
lunch. Crackers will keep for two to three weeks stored in an
airtight container. If the crackers lose some of their crispness,
heat them at 250 F for about 5 minutes.

DIRECTIONS: =========== Position two racks in the center and the
bottom third of the oven, and preheat the oven to 350 F.

Spread 2 tablespoons sesame seeds on each of three unoiled baking
sheets. This will prevent the crackers from sticking and will give
them a delicious crisp bottom.

Put the water, oil, and salt in a small bowl until combined. Stir in
the 1/2 cup sesame seeds.  Add the water-oil mixture and mix to form
a rough dough. Knead the dough in the bowl to form a ball, and turn
out onto a lightly floured work surface.

Lightly flour a rolling pin.  Roll the dough out into a 22- by 14-inch
rectangle, about 1/16-inch thick. Using a fork, prick the dough all
over to release trapped air and keep the dough flat. With a pizza
wheel or sharp knife, cut the dough into 2-inch squares or other
shapes, or cut shapes with a 2-inch cookie cutter.

Using a spatula, transfer the crackers to the prepared baking sheets.
Bake until the crackers are light brown and firm to the touch, 15 to
20 minutes, switching the positions of the sheets halfway through the
baking time. When the first two sheets are finished, remove them, and
bake the third one as directed.  Cool completely.

Whole Wheat Sourdough

breads, breadmaker

2 teaspoon yeast
2 cup whole wheat bread flour
1 1/3 cup unbleached bread flour
2 tablespoon buttermilk powder
2 tablespoon vital wheat gluten
2 tablespoon lecithin
2 teaspoon salt; lite
2 teaspoon wheat germ
1/2 teaspoon ginger
2 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon honey
1/2 cup whole wheat s/d starter (you
1 cup water; (i use bottled h20)
1/2  margarine, room temp.

I used the whole wheat starter and experimented with your whole wheat
bread recipe in the DAK today. It turned out great. Basically, I just
halved your recipe and added a few things. My DAK is a 3 cup flour
model, is yours? If I'm using whole wheat or rye flour, I can add
more flour because it doesn't rise as much.  Also, whenever I use
whole wheat, etc. I add vital wheat gluten and lecithin to aid
elasticity and to help it rise. This is what I put in the DAK and the
order I used: Turn the light/dark setting to 12 o'clock and set the
menu to Sweet Bread (the auto. one, not the manual one) Later, at the
beeps, I added 3/4 c. pecans (didn't have walnuts on hand). I usually
add large pieces since they are kind of cut up by the B/M while knead
ing. We can keep experimenting with this....let me know if you try it
and what you add or subtract. Have you ever added raisins, oatmeal or
any kind of seeds? The B/M gives me the lazy way out, and I wanted to
see what it would do in it.  Thanks so much for taking precious time
to post the recipe. P.S. I have some of the beer s/d starter to give
you when we get together, but the whole wheat starter is GREAT!.

In a glass or ceramic bowl or jar that has been scalded, combine
flour and yeast, add water and blend well. Cover with plastic wrap
and pierce with fork to release gases. Place in a warm, draft-free
location at an even 85F for 18-24 hrs; stir several times daily.
Refrigerate until ready to use. If you have several starters, keep
whole wheat separate from others to preserve its own distinctive
flavor. Whole wheat starter does not have as much rising action as
that made with white flour; you may have to plan longer rising times.
To replenish, always use whole wheat flour.

1 cup wild rice; cooked
1  egg; beaten with
1 tablespoon water
1/2 cup sunflower seeds; hulled

The Chef or Starter (Based by Thorne on the method of Lionel Poilane)

1. Pour one-half cup of (unchlorinated) water into a bowl. Work in
enough flour to make a "moist but cohering dough." Prac- tice will
make this stage obvious: when the soupy slurry turns to a solid,
puttylike mass that can be massaged (kneaded) into a small, elastic
ball. Please note that no commercial yeast has been added. This
starter will ferment, if it does ferment, be- cause of the presence,
either in the ambient air or in the flour, of naturally occurring
yeasts and symbiotic bacteria.

2. Put the starter in a small bowl. Cover with a damp dish towel
secured by a rubber band. Leave on a shelf in a draft-free kitchen
for three days, re-moistening the towel as needed (and when possible:
clearly, the atmosphere in your kitchen may dry out the towel so
rapidly that only round-the clock surveillance will really keep the
towel continually moist. Eternal vigilance is impossible, but do your
best. Also please note that no kitchen temperature is specified,
since you will probably have to work with what you've got. Unheated
kitchens in severe winter weather are obviously not the ideal, but
the normal range of temperature in a modern home should work in
something like the times speci- fied here and below).

3. The starter is activated when it looks and smells active.
Fermentation produces a noticeable expansion in its size and a
slightly "tangy" odor. It can then be used or refrigerated for
several days.

The Levain, or Sponge: 8-ounce starter, 2 1/2 cups flour,

Put the starter in a bowl with 1 1/4 cups cold water (cold to slow the
fermentation, on the theory that a long rising at this point improves
flavor and. be cause it relaxes the gluten, makes the job of working
in the water easier). Work until the starter has completely
dissolved. (Thorne uses his hands: an electric hand beater is it much
more efficient. Just add a little water at a time.) Stir in the flour
and the salt to make a loose mass. With floured hands move it to a
clean bowl. Cover with a damp towel and a piece of plastic wrap.
Secure with a rubber band and leave to ripen overnight in a cool
place (Thorne specifies 60 degrees).

The Loaf: 1 sponge, Flour, Cornmeal

1. Put the sponge on a well-floured surface. Begin to work in the new
flour. The idea is to knead in as much flour as the sponge will "take"
until it turns into silken, nonsticky dough that is a pleasure to
work. No amount of flour is specified. The limiting factor is the 1
1/4 cups of water added at the sponge stage. This kneading stage
takes 12 to 15 minutes, during which the movement activates the
elasticity of the gluten and traps air in the dough so that the yeast
can do its work.

2. Dust the dough with flour, put it in a large, lightly oiled bowl,
cover with a damp towel and let rise to double in bulk. This is a
fairly fast rise and needs a warm environment, around 80 degrees, for
one to three hours, usually about two.

3. Flour your hands and gently rework the dough to break up air
bubbles. Pinch off an egg-shaped piece of the dough and reserve as
the starter for subsequent adventures. Line a colander with a
generously floured towel, and secure it around the colan- der's
perimeter with a rubber band. Set the dough on the towel and let rise
almost as far as it did on the first rise.

4. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Heat the base of the bread cloche.

5. When the dough is ready, sprinkle the cloche base liber- ally with
corn meal. Then, grasping the towel, pick up the loaf, and roll it
gently onto the cloche base so that the round part faces up. Slash
the surface in three places with a sharp knife or single edged razor
blade. Place in oven, cover with cloche top, and bake for 15 minutes.

6. Reduce heat to 400 degrees and bake another 20 minutes. Then
remove the cloche top to brown the crust for about 10 minutes. The
loaf is done if it sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. After it
cools, store in a closed paper bag.

Yield: One crusty loaf.

Wiltshire Lardy Cake

breads

1/2 lb strong white bread flour
1 teaspoon easy-blend yeast
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 oz melted lard
1/4 pint warm water (or milk & water)
      ----TO FINISH----
1/4 lb pure pork lard; diced
1  lard for greasing the pan
1  cinnamon
1  allspice
1  demerara sugar
      ----MIX TOGETHER THE FOLLOWING----
1 oz sultanas; chopped
1 oz raisins; chopped
1 oz currents; chopped
1 oz chopped candied peel

Using a food-mixer or processor or your hands, mix and knead the
dough. Cover it with oiled polythene and leave to rise until doubled
in size; this will take about 1 hour in a warm place.

Knock back the dough, knead it again briefly and roll out to an
oblong. Mix together 1-1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon
ground allspice and 2 ounces sugar and sprinkle half of this mixture
over the dough. Add half the dried fruits and half the diced lard.
Roll up the dough, like a swiss roll, give it a quarter turn and roll
it out to an oblong again. Sprinkle with sugar and spices, dried
fruits and fat exactly as before. Then roll up and roll out the dough
to an oblong once again, but this time make it the right size to fit
a shallow baking or roasting tin about 7-inches square. Grease the
tin and put the dough into it, pressing it well into the corners.
Cover and leave to prove (rise) until the dough is light, puffy and
well risen.

Score the top of the dough with a diamond pattern, brush with melted
lard and sprinkle on 1 ounce of sugar. Bake at 425 F (220 C) gas mark
7 until cooked to a golden brown and smelling delicious, 35-40
minutes.

Cool the cake briefly in the tin so that the melted fat is
re-absorbed, then serve it while still warm, cut into large sticky
fingers. Makes 1 cake

Winter Squash Herb Bread

breads, seasonings

1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup butter or margarine
2 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon baking yeast warm water
3 cup unbleached flour
2  eggs; lightly beaten
1 cup finely chopped fresh sage or- dried; sage
1 tablespoon finely chopped dill weed; or- dried dill weed
4  garlic cloves; crushed
1 teaspoon salt

Combine the milk, butter, and sugar in a small saucepan and heat,
stirring, until the butter is melted. Remove from heat and set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Add 2
cups of flour and the eggs, squash, sage, dill, garlic, and salt. Mix
slightly to combine ingredients. When the milk mixture has cooled to
lukewarm, stir it in with the rest of the ingredients to form a
sticky ball.

Add the remaining flour 1/3 cup at a time, mixing to moisten each
addition, until the dough becomes smooth. It will be wet and slightly
sticky. Cover your hands with a little flour, turn the dough out onto
a lightly floured surface, and knead briefly.

Form the dough into a ball and place in a lightly greased loaf pan.
It can also be divided into small balls to make dinner rolls (place
on a lightly greased cookie sheet or in a muffin tin). Cover with
plastic wrap and let rise until the dough has more than doubled,
about 1 to 1-1/2 hours. While the dough is rising, preheat oven to
275 degrees F.

Place the risen dough in the oven and bake until the top is golden
brown and the sides are slightly brown, an hour or 70 minutes. Check
the sides by pulling the bread out of the pan. When done, cool bread
on a wire rack, then serve or wrap and refrigerate.

2 1/2 cup whole wht pastry flour (1)
2 cup whole wht pastry flour (2)
3 1/4 cup whole wht pastry flour (3)
3/4 cup whole wht pastry flour (4)

In a bowl combine maple syrup, yeast and first of flour. In sauce pan
heat juice and butter until almost melted. With mixer gradually beat
liquid into yeast mixture. dry ingredients. Set aside egg white for
brushing top of loaves. Add in egg yolk, remaining eggs, lemon peel,
almond extract, and second flour (2) to make a thick batter. Stir in

and knead until smooth, continuing to add fourth flour (4). Knead at
least 15 minutes.

Place in lightly oiled bowl, turning dough so top is oiled too. Let
rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down dough. Turn onto floured
work surface, separate dough for loaves; cut dough for each loaf into
3 equal parts.  Cover and let rest 15 minutes. Lightly oil two cookie
sheets.

On floured work surface, roll each piece into a 24" length. Place
three lengths together and braid; it comes out best if you begin in
the middle and work toward each end. Shape into a ring, join the ends
and pinch together. Repeat with each loaf. Cover rings with towels
and let rise in warm place 1 hour.

Mix first 8 ingredients. Divide into 24 portions. Cut aspic into 24
portions. Knead dough 5 min; roll out into a thin baguette; cut into
24 pieces. Flatten each piece into a 2" round; then go around with
your fingers and squeeze the edges thin - the result should be a
medium-thin center and a thin outside. Put 1 portion (1/2 oz) filling
in the center of each round; top with 1 portion of aspic. Bring up
the sides of each round and twist up in a decorative pattern, making
sure to seal the top. If holes appear, patch them at once!

Put each dumpling on a square of waxed paper or a piece of bok choy
leaf and steam, preferably in a bamboo steamer, for 8 min. Serve hot.

Note on aspic:

If you don't have any on hand, use about 1 1/2 c of homemade chicken
broth (or good-quality canned low-salt broth): boil 1 c of broth,
uncovered, for about 2 min (reducing it quite a bit) while dissolving
1 envelope gelatin in the other 1/2 c. Mix together and stir over low
heat until all gelatin is dissolved. Chill. This will make a hard
aspic, enough for 3 recipes of this dim sum.

Yoghurt Sourdough Starter *

breads

1 cup low fat milk
2 tablespoon natural plain yoghurt
1 cup white flour

Heat milk to 100F on thermometer. Remove from heat and stir in
yoghurt. Pour into scalded glass jar or bowl, cover with plastic and
place in a warm location for 18 hrs. Consistency will be like thin
yoghurt. Stir in flour until well blended, cover again with plastic
and pierce with fork to release gases. Place in a warm draft-free
location at an even 85F for 2 days; stir several times each day. It
should have a strong sourdough smell and show bubbles. Refrigerate
until ready to use. When replenishing starter, add lukewarm milk
instead of water.

Yogurt Bran Muffins

breads, quick bread

1 cup yogurt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3/4 cup brown sugar
1  egg
1 cup natural bran
1 cup flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup berries/peaches/raisins

Combine yogurt and soda.  Use a big bowl - it foams.

Mix oil, sugar, eggs, and bran.  Add yogurt.

Add flour, baking powder, and salt.  Fold in fruit.

Raisins are good with strawberry or raspberry yogurt. Otherwise, match
yogurt to fruit.

*Note:  At work (where I got this), my boss saves up odds and ends of
yogurt all week, and she dumps them all together to make this
brown-looking mess of yogurt. It doesn't taste different in the
muffins, though, and you can toss in any kind of fruit with it.

Yogurt Pancakes

breads

5 large eggs
1 1/4 cup milk
8 oz yogurt, plain
4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup vegetable oil (or less for dieters; but use at least 2 t)
2 1/3 cup flour, white (measure carefully aft; er sifting)
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt

Preheat griddle and oil very very lightly.  Separate the eggs; beat the
yolks in a bowl big enough to hold the whole recipe. Add the yogurt and
beat again; add the milk and oil and beat again. Rinse the eggbeater.

In a separate bowl, mix all the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder,
sugar and salt). Sift together. I use a flour sifter for this, but if you
insist on measuring your flour without sifting it, then you can try using a
wire whip to blend the dry ingredients. Using a clean eggbeater, beat the
egg whites until they are fluffy.

Dump the dry ingredient mixture into the big bowl containing the milk
mixture, stir for about 2 seconds just to get the dry ingredients under the
surface of the liquid, and then dump the beaten egg whites into the big
bowl.

Now beat this mixture lightly and slowly with a fork until it is more or
less uniform. If you beat too much, or too fast, then it will get gummy.
Don't try to get rid of lumps. Cook on the hot griddle.

NOTES:

* I use Dannon and Knudsen yogart, other brands might require different
amounts

*  Amazingly good baking-powder and yogurt pancakes -- Cooks like to show
off by making fancy glamorous recipes to serve to their friends by candle
light. Here is a simple ordinary recipe to serve to your family for
breakfast in the morning.

I love pancakes and I make many varieties and I am an inveterate
experimenter. This recipe is the one I have developed over the years to
replace buttermilk pancakes because I never have buttermilk on hand in the
refrigerator like my grandmother did. I made this recipe this very morning
with blueberries in it. I do have yogurt in my fridge, though, and the
yogurt can substitute for the buttermilk. Yield: Serves 4-6.

*  I like to put fresh blueberries in these pancakes after I pour them on
the griddle. Make sure that your maple syrup is hot and that your butter is
soft. You can heat syrup in the microwave or you can heat it by sticking
the syrup jar in a pan of boiling water.

*  This same recipe also makes really good waffles if you reduce the milk
to about 1 cup, but if you are going to make waffles, you shouldn't cut
back on the oil. If you are dieting, stick to pancakes.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  10 minutes plus cooking time.
: Precision:  measure carefully.

Yogurt Rye Bread

breads

1 1/2 cup warm water
2 pkg dry yeast
1 cup plain yogurt
1/4 cup 9-grain cereal
1 cup bran flakes
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoon butter; softened
1 cup rye flour
2 1/2 cup all-purpose flour (or more)
1 tablespoon fennel seeds
2 tablespoon cornmeal
      ----GLAZE----
1  egg yolk; mixed with
1 tablespoon water

IN A LARGE MIXING BOWL, stir the warm water and yeast together, and
let stand for a minute or so to dissolve. Stir in the yogurt, 9-grain
cereal, bran flakes, salt, butter, rye flour and 1 1/2 cups of the
all-purpose flour. Beat vigorously until well blended. Add enough
all-purpose flour to make a manageable dough, then turn out onto a
lightly floured surface. Knead for a few minutes, then let rest for
10 minutes. Resume kneading for a good 10 minutes, until the dough is
elastic, sprinkling on a little more all-purpose flour as necessary
to keep it from being too sticky. Knead in the fennel seeds. Place in
a large greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap or a clean damp cloth,
and let rise until double in bulk. Punch the dough down and divide
into 3 equal parts. Roll each piece into a long round strand about
3/4-inch thick, making them all the same length. Pinch the strands
together at one end, and braid. When you've finished braiding, pinch
both ends together firmly and tuck them under a bit, to give the loaf
a neat look. Transfer to a baking sheet that's been sprinkled with
the cornmeal, cover loosely, and let rise again until double in bulk.
Brush with the egg-yolk mixture, and bake in a preheated 350F oven
for 45 minutes. Remove from the sheet and cool on a rack. Makes 1 Loaf

Yorkshire Pudding 2

breads, quick bread

2  eggs
1 cup milk
1 cup sifted flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1  beef drippings

I find it best to mix this well in advance and chill it before
cooking.

Beat the eggs and milk together. Sift the flour and salt into the egg
mixture and beat until well blended.

Heat the oven to 450 F. Pour about 1/4 c of beef drippings into and
11 x 7 inch backing pan or muffin tin and heat the drippings until
they begin to smoke. Pour in the batter and place in the oven for 10
minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 F and bake for a further 15
minutes.

This is about enough for four normal people although I could eat half
of this myself.

I find that opening the oven door during the baking can produce
disappointing results so I don't. From: David Gibbons Converted by

Yutangza (Steamed Cilantro Buns)

breads, russian

1 pkg yeast, dry
2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 cup ; water, lukewarm
1/2 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
8 tablespoon butter, sweet
3 cup flour, unbleached
1 cup cilantro, fresh; finely chop

Approx. Cook Time: 2:30 In a
large bowl, combine the yeast, sugar, and water and let proof. Stir
in the milk, salt, and two tablespoons of the butter and mix well
with a wooden spoon. Stir in three cups of the flour, one cup at a
time, stirring well after each addition. Transfer the dough to a
floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about eight
minutes, adding enough of the remaining flour to prevent sticking.
Shape the dough into a ball. Place in a buttered bowl and turn to
coat. Cover with a tea towel and let rise in a warm, draft-free place
until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch the dough down and
knead briefly. Divide into sixteen parts and shape each into a ball.
On a floured surface with a floured rolling pin, roll out one ball to
a round about 1/16" thick. Brush generously with melted butter and
sprinkle all over with cilantro. Fold in the edges of the round so
they meet in the center and roll into a smooth bun between the palms
of your hands. Repeat with the remaining balls of dough. Place the
buns on a buttered baking sheet, brush lightly with melted butter,
and let them rise, covered, for about 20 minutes. In a bamboo or
metal steamer set over simmering water, steam as many buns as will
fit without touching, partially covered, until cooked through, about
20 minutes. Steam the rest of the buns. Serve slightly warm.

Zucchini Bread

breads, low fat

1 1/4 cup oatmeal
3 cup flour
3 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 tablespoon grated orange peel
1/4 teaspoon salt
2  eggs
2 teaspoon vanilla
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 cup applesauce
3 cup grated zucchini
2/3 cup sugar

In large bowl, mix together oatmeal, flour, baking powder,
cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, orange peel and salt.  In separate bowl,
beat together eggs, sugar, vanilla, oil and applesauce.  Add dry
ingredients, mixing until blended.  Turn into 2 greased and floured
loaf pans.
Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 1 hour or until done.  Makes 2
loaves.

Zucchini is virtually effortless to grate on a hand-held cheese
grater, but even easier in a food processor fitted with a shredding
disk.  Drain shredded zucchini and let stand in a colander a few
minutes to allow moisture to drain away.

Zucchini bread recipe from Ralph Hunter/114 W. Forest
Ave./Hodgenville, KY 42748 on 08/23/93.  He said he got the recipe
from Margaret Garmon of Cumberland County, Ky., where Ralph and his
wife Edith lived all of their lives until moving to Hodgenville in
April 1993. Mary L. Harmon, my cleaning lady, said it was the best
zucchini bread she'd ever had. Ralph frosted it with the penuche
frosting. The penuche frosting recipe is from _Betty Crocker's
Cookbook_. New York: Golden Press, 1969. Twelfth printing, 1972.

Zucchini Bread Baked In A Jar

breads

3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
2 cup sugar
3 large eggs
1 cup oil
2 cup zucchini, grated
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup pecans, chopped

Sterilize 8 Ball Quilted Crystal (#14400-81400) jam/jelly canning
jars, lids and rings by boiling them for 15 minutes. Remove the jars
from the water and allow them to air dry; leave the lids and rings in
the hot water until you're ready to use them--the rings MUST be hot
when used. If you can find them, you can also use 4 (1-1/2 pint)
straight-sided jars. They must NOT have buldges in the sides of the
jars or you won't be able to get the cakes out without digging them
out. Look for the number of the jar I've given you--once you see what
they look like, you'll know what to look for. Once the jars are cool
enough to handle, grease them with shortening (DO NOT use butter,
margarine, PAM or Baker's Secret). Fill jars 1/2 full; place onto a
cookie sheet.

Preheat oven to 325-degrees (NO HIGHER!)

Sift together the flour, salt, baking powder baking soda, cinnamon and
cloves; set aside.

Beat eggs until foamy.  Add sugar, oil, zucchini and vanilla. Mix
well with beater. Add flour mixture to zucchini mixture. Add nuts.

For the pint jars, bake for about 35 minutes, moving the jars around
in the oven so they'll bake evenly. Start checking the cakes at 25
minutes, and go from there. The bread needs to be done, but not
over-done. For the 1-1/2 pint jars, bake for about 1 hour and 15
minutes; start checking them at 1 hour and go from there.

Using HEAVY DUTY MITTS (the jars ARE HOT!), remove the jars from the
oven one-at-a-time. Place a lid, then a ring on top and screw down
tightly. Place jars onto your counter top to cool completely. You'll
know when they've sealed, you'll hear a "plinking" sound. In case you
don't hear it, double- check the jars by pushing down in the middle
of the lids once the jars have sealed--they shouldn't move at all.

Zuchini Bread

breads

6 each eggs
2 cup oil
4 cup grated squash
2 cup sugar
6 cup flour
4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon vanilla

Combine ingredients in Large bowl, mix well.  Pour into greased and
floured loaf pans.  Bake at 350 for 1 hour. Serve hot or cold with
butter, cream cheese, or just plain. Mmmmm. Variations: Applesauce or
pumpkin bread - use same as zuchini, but add 3 cups water and 4 tsp
ginger. Another thing I did often, was bake the batter in
cupcake/muffin tins. Then when the kids wanted a snack, they could
just take "one" without the worry or mess of slicing from the loaf.
